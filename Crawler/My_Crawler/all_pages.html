<br><br>Why do we keep going<br>back and forth?<br><br>Jay is happy here.<br><br>I don't care.<br><br>No, no.<br><br>We-<br><br>Let me call you back.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>Deidra wants full<br>custody of Jay.<br><br>Well?<br><br>She makes a few valid points.<br><br>Pam.<br><br>Looks like she's<br>completed parenting classes.<br><br>Steady job and her own place.<br><br>And it's true, you both<br>have a hectic schedule.<br><br>Plus you moved twice<br>in three years.<br><br>So?<br><br>A lot of people have<br>hectic schedules<br><br>and people move, so what?<br><br>It means that Jay had<br>to change schools twice.<br><br>And what I see, she's not<br>attacking you, Charles.<br><br>Her claim is Jay needs a mother.<br><br>I can have a petition<br>filed in with the court<br><br>by close of business today.<br><br>No, no courts.<br><br>All right, she sent me a<br>personal letter for a reason.<br><br>She's up to something.<br><br>The press finds out that there's<br>a custody battle brewing,<br><br>We need other options.<br><br>Charles, you do know<br>that I don't work for you?<br><br>You married my sister.<br><br>I'm only trying to help.<br><br>Pam, please.<br><br>He's sorry.<br><br>What are our options?<br><br>Reason with her.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Excuse me, miss, miss.<br><br>Excuse me, miss, excuse me?<br><br>Excuse me, miss.<br><br>- Deidra, Deidra.<br>- Excuse me?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>♪ You and I you and I<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Deidra, what are you doing?<br><br>"You and I" will<br>be released tomorrow<br><br>and every urban black radio<br>station in the country<br><br>will be picking it up.<br><br>Tammy, did you hear<br>what I just said?<br><br>She should have been here<br>30 minutes ago, Charles.<br><br>This is just her way<br>of defining the terms.<br><br>All right, it's what she does.<br><br>How could you be so<br>calm about all of this?<br><br>Well, because you're<br>nervous enough for both of us.<br><br>Look, now I'm open<br>to many things,<br><br>but giving up my son<br>is not an option.<br><br>I know we agreed to<br>leave our past in the past,<br><br>but what happened<br>between you and Deidra?<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Charles.<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>He has this little<br>basketball ritual<br><br>he's obsessed with these days.<br><br>I mean, I can go get him.<br><br>That's right,<br>the Steph Curry thing.<br><br>He told me about it.<br><br>No, it's fine.<br><br>I think we need to talk.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I was hoping that<br>we could speak alone,<br><br>'cause what needs to be said<br><br>shouldn't be said in front<br>of um, mixed company.<br><br>Whatever we need to talk about<br><br>can be said in front of Tammy.<br><br>Charles, it's okay.<br><br>You guys should talk.<br><br>So we're alone<br>just like you wanted.<br><br>Let's talk.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>You seem to have done<br>pretty well for yourself<br><br>since our divorce.<br><br>Can't help but wonder<br>if our little breakup<br><br>inspired some of these hits.<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Kidding.<br><br>I am.<br><br>You're a great producer.<br><br>That's why I fell<br>in love with you.<br><br>But you married a star.<br><br>She's not me, but she's<br>a star nonetheless.<br><br>Look, I thought you<br>wanted to talk about Jay.<br><br>We are talking about Jay.<br><br>I've been doing better,<br><br>and so now I think it's time<br><br>for me to be the mother<br>Jay needs me to be.<br><br>And that's why I'm allowing<br>you to spend time with Jay.<br><br>Now after the hospital<br>discharged you,<br><br>I knew it was important<br>for Jay to see his mother,<br><br>but why full custody?<br><br>I mean, his life is stable.<br><br>I'm his mother and I<br>know what's best for him.<br><br>Then why haven't you been here?<br><br>It's been me and Tammy, not you.<br><br>Tammy isn't his real mother.<br><br>She's gotta go on tour.<br><br>She's gotta record.<br><br>He's my blood and not hers.<br><br>This is our family.<br><br>And Tammy is a part<br>of that now, Deidra.<br><br>But can you do it without me?<br><br>Look at this room.<br><br>Look, the awards, the prestige.<br><br>There's not an<br>ounce of me in it.<br><br>I am not gonna<br>apologize for my success.<br><br>You erased me.<br><br>But you're not gonna erase<br>me from Jay's life, too.<br><br>A boy needs his mother.<br><br>Let's start with<br>a few sleepovers.<br><br>Can we do that?<br><br>It's a start.<br><br>Mama.<br><br>- Hi baby.<br>- Hey.<br><br>You ready to go?<br><br>I have to get my bag.<br><br>Okay, um, where's your dad?<br><br>You know dad, some trip.<br><br>He'll be home tomorrow.<br><br>So you're alone with Tammy?<br><br>Yeah, Tammy and Aunt Pam<br>are out back doing yoga.<br><br>I can go get them.<br><br>Nope, don't.<br><br>Just go get your bag.<br><br>I have a lot of surprises<br><br>planned for you this<br>weekend, mister.<br><br>Okay, um, you wanna see my room?<br><br>I shouldn't.<br><br>It's cool, they won't mind.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I'm proud of you, sis.<br><br>The whole family is.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You know it doesn't<br>even feel really yet.<br><br>It will.<br><br>And when it does,<br><br>I'm here to negotiate<br>your new contract.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>I'm just happy you're here.<br><br>Sometimes I feel like the<br>third wheel around this place.<br><br>I thought Mr. Right<br>treated you like gold.<br><br>No, it is not that.<br><br>It's Deidra.<br><br>She haunts this place,<br><br>and if I even mention her,<br>Charles completely shuts down.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>I love it.<br><br>Um, you know what?<br><br>I think we should go to<br>someplace fancy for dinner.<br><br>Why don't you grab a jacket,<br><br>an extra outfit,<br>and something nice.<br><br>You think you can do that?<br><br>Mom, this is me<br>you're talking to.<br><br>Okay then.<br><br>Go and uh, get<br>something really nice.<br><br>No basketball jerseys.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Take your time.<br><br>What do you know about her?<br><br>Uh, not much.<br><br>Just that when Charles<br>filed for divorce,<br><br>she took it really hard<br><br>and disappeared when<br>Jay was younger.<br><br>She disappeared?<br><br>I guess.<br><br>But she is back now and<br>she appears to be stable<br><br>and she's ready to be a mom<br>again, so I'm happy for her.<br><br>Truly, I am, because<br>when she's good,<br><br>that means that Jay's good.<br><br>But aren't you curious<br>about what happened?<br><br>Nah.<br><br>I have to respect<br>that, you know?<br><br>Let the past be the past.<br><br>What about you?<br><br>What about me?<br><br>As long as<br>Jay's under this roof,<br><br>Deidre's gonna be coming around.<br><br>You need to know what<br>you're up against.<br><br>What does that<br>mean, "Up against?"<br><br>If I was her,<br><br>I'd wanna know everything<br>about the woman around my kid.<br><br>Especially if she's<br>about to become<br><br>the biggest star in the world.<br><br>Mama.<br><br>What are you doing<br>in dad's room?<br><br>I was looking for the restroom.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Come on, let's go.<br><br>You know,<br><br>I just want Deidra to respect<br>me and the way I care for Jay,<br><br>like I respect her.<br><br>Besides, I wanna have<br>kids of my own one day.<br><br>Well, if she keeps<br>disrespecting my sister,<br><br>I will show her how<br>real of a sister I am.<br><br>Ooh.<br><br>I'll stomp a hole<br>in her real quick.<br><br>What?<br><br>I'll knock her teeth out.<br>Don't get me started. Uhn-uh<br><br>T.<br><br>Uh, okay, so look,<br>I told Jay that I,<br><br>I could have stayed in the car.<br><br>If I overstepped.<br><br>Oh no, please, Deidre.<br><br>Don't be silly, we're-<br><br>- Thank you for allowing me<br><br>to take my child<br>for the weekend.<br><br>Um, you know what?<br><br>I wanna apologize<br>about the other day.<br><br>I'm truly grateful<br><br>for everything that<br>you've done for my child.<br><br>Is there any way that we<br>could just, I don't know.<br><br>Can we start over?<br><br>I'd like that.<br><br>Cool, how about tonight?<br><br>Tonight?<br><br>Um...<br><br>Yeah, my liquor cabinet,<br>it stays open pretty late.<br><br>Tonight may not<br>work, only because-<br><br>- Oh, I get it, that's right.<br><br>You probably have a bunch<br>of text messages to read.<br><br>It's okay, it's cool.<br><br>Come on baby, let's go.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>How late does your<br>liquor cabinet stay open?<br><br>It's not much,<br><br>but um, Jay has his own room<br><br>and it's in a good<br>school district.<br><br>Um, I think it's great.<br><br>Let's do this.<br><br>Let's.<br><br>So how did you meet Charles?<br><br>Uh, my sister, Pam.<br><br>Pam.<br><br>Cute.<br><br>Yeah, it's actually<br>a really funny story.<br><br>So they were- A toast.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What are we toasting to?<br><br>You, silly.<br><br>Your song, it's amazing.<br><br>It's the prettiest song<br>that I've ever heard.<br><br>Thank you, Deidra.<br><br>I almost feel like I<br>have a connection to it.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>No, it's funny you say that<br><br>because I felt the same<br>exact way when I heard it.<br><br>You heard it?<br><br>Yeah, the demo.<br><br>Charles had written<br>it years ago,<br><br>and when I heard this song,<br><br>I just knew I had to sing it.<br><br>So he never released it?<br><br>Uh-uh, he said he could never<br>find the right voice for it,<br><br>till now.<br><br>What exactly did<br>Charles tell you about me?<br><br>What does anybody ever<br>tell anyone about their ex?<br><br>- Fair enough.<br>- Mm.<br><br>Well, we met when I was<br>in my second year in college<br><br>and he had just had<br>this serious breakup<br><br>with Jessica Dawson.<br><br>Jessica Dawson.<br><br>By that look, you've<br>heard that name before.<br><br>She really broke his heart.<br><br>But her loss was my gain, right?<br><br>And I was in school<br>for computer graphics,<br><br>but he saw right through.<br><br>He knew I wanted to make music.<br><br>So you sing.<br><br>Dabbled.<br><br>You know Charles, he makes<br>you feel like a star.<br><br>Mm.<br><br>He used to keep his uh,<br>his songs in these journals.<br><br>Yeah, he still does that.<br><br>And we would go to the studio<br><br>and we would record<br>these amazing love songs.<br><br>But then it led to more love<br>making than making music.<br><br>I think sex inspires him.<br><br>And then Jay was born and uh,<br><br>there was no more<br>time for music.<br><br>At least that's what he told me.<br><br>So is that why you stopped?<br><br>We both did.<br><br>We got married and we tried<br>to make the family thing work.<br><br>He went back to work at a<br>old manufacturing plant.<br><br>I went back to school<br>and we really tried,<br><br>and we were a family,<br>until we weren't.<br><br>He didn't tell you that, did he?<br><br>Uh, no.<br><br>Just that I'm a crazy<br>mama that abandoned her kid.<br><br>No, Deidre, he never said any-<br><br>- I had so much love<br>for him, for our family,<br><br>until he got arrested.<br><br>That was the<br>beginning of the end.<br><br>Arrested?<br><br>I've said too much.<br><br>No, you haven't said enough.<br><br>What was he arrested for?<br><br>Whatever happened<br>with us is in the past.<br><br>He's with you now.<br><br>Yeah, but he never<br>told me any of this.<br><br>I'm not gonna start any more<br>trouble than I already have.<br><br>He's found his way<br>back to his music.<br><br>He's happy.<br><br>You're happy.<br><br>And Jay's happy.<br><br>I had a lawyer draw those<br>up and I signed them.<br><br>I realized that there was<br>no upside for a waitress<br><br>up against a successful<br>music producer in court.<br><br>Take it.<br><br>Besides, a custody<br>battle is no way to start<br><br>a healthy co-parenting<br>relationship.<br><br>Wow, Deidra.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>This was fun.<br><br>It was.<br><br>We should do it again.<br><br>Oh, by tomorrow,<br>you will be so famous<br><br>you won't remember that<br>cheap wine I served you.<br><br>Oh, from me, your<br>lips to God's ears.<br><br>And that wine was not<br>that cheap, Deidra.<br><br>That's just Renegade,<br>the neighbors dog.<br><br>It's, he's harmless.<br><br>He don't sound that harmless.<br><br>You get used to it.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>And what has got<br>you smiling so hard?<br><br>It's not a what, it's a who.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Who?<br><br>Some guy.<br><br>He uh, wants me to<br>send him a naughty pic.<br><br>Ooh, do you like him?<br><br>Yeah, maybe, I don't know.<br><br>Hey, do it, okay?<br><br>You only live once.<br><br>What, is he cute?<br><br>You'll see him soon enough.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well um, I should get going,<br><br>but I'm really glad we<br>got the chance to do this.<br><br>Likewise.<br><br>Thank you, Deidra.<br><br>You, uh, tell Charles<br>to stay outta trouble.<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>Tammy, why aren't you ready?<br><br>We have a meeting with<br>Satellite Radio at 11 o'clock.<br><br>All right, this industry<br>doesn't give second chances.<br><br>We can't blow this.<br><br>You know, that's funny,<br>because you got a second chance.<br><br>What?<br><br>I went and saw<br>Deidre last night.<br><br>Why would you do that?<br><br>You know, probably<br>for the same reason<br><br>you never told me why<br>you were arrested.<br><br>Look, baby.<br><br>Look, do not "baby" me.<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>Look, it's the past, all right?<br><br>She's the past.<br><br>All right, let it go.<br><br>Why didn't you tell<br>me that she sings,<br><br>or anything about<br>her for that matter?<br><br>Or should I let that go, too?<br><br>What else are you<br>hiding from me, Charles?<br><br>It's not what you think.<br><br>Look, I did it for Jay.<br><br>Okay, I kept secrets for him.<br><br>All right, look.<br><br>I was arrested for assault.<br><br>All right, some<br>guy said I hit him<br><br>after I saw him and<br>Deidra flirting.<br><br>I got jealous and<br>confronted him.<br><br>And did you hit him?<br><br>No, no, but the police<br>didn't believe me.<br><br>I was a hothead back then<br><br>and it wasn't the first time<br>I was in trouble with the law.<br><br>Not your first time?<br><br>Look, our<br>relationship was toxic.<br><br>She reveled in the drama.<br><br>Yeah, but why<br>didn't you tell me?<br><br>Well, I had my record expunged.<br><br>Right, I paid a PR<br>team to erase me<br><br>and Deidra's internet history<br><br>because I didn't<br>want Jay to know<br><br>he had a father<br>that was a criminal<br><br>and a mother who went to a<br>mental health institution.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>I bet she left<br>that part out, too.<br><br>Well, did she sing?<br><br>Did she sing?<br><br>Yeah, a little.<br><br>But she wasn't a star.<br><br>Not like you.<br><br>Charles, I am your wife.<br><br>Do you know how stupid I felt?<br><br>It's like I don't even know you.<br><br>Now you know me.<br><br>So does Deidra and Jessica.<br><br>Look, I know I betrayed<br>your trust in the past,<br><br>and I know I don't deserve<br>it, but I'm asking you,<br><br>look Tammy, you're<br>raising my son.<br><br>Hell, I won't pretend that<br>I can do this without you.<br><br>No more secrets, Tammy.<br><br>Okay, I promise.<br><br>Deidra's not seeking<br>full custody anymore.<br><br>She's okay with co-parenting.<br><br>Well, well how?<br><br>I mean.<br><br>Does it matter?<br><br>It's done.<br><br>Hey, I mean, I don't<br>know what to say.<br><br>I mean, I'm just-<br><br>- You know what, Charles, just,<br><br>promise me you'll be honest<br>with me from here on out.<br><br>Baby, I promise.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Charles' file is sealed,<br><br>but the other guy's file isn't.<br><br>Jimmy Franklin, a real shit bag.<br><br>Habitual criminal with<br>more assault charges<br><br>than he has birthdays.<br><br>How will this help<br>me get to the truth?<br><br>Charles didn't do it.<br><br>He didn't?<br><br>Page six, superstar.<br><br>What is this I'm looking at?<br><br>It's a transcript<br>from a criminal case<br><br>where Jimmy was a<br>state star witness.<br><br>The defense attorney<br>raised concerns<br><br>about his credibility<br>as a witness.<br><br>He cites Charles's<br>case as his reason.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Jimmy Franklin knowingly and<br>willingly pressed false charges<br><br>on Charles Harper<br>only to drop his claim<br><br>after his allegations<br>could not be corroborated.<br><br>Why would he do that?<br><br>Why does any man do<br>what he does for a woman?<br><br>I gotta go.<br><br>I have this IG Live thing I<br>have to do, but thank you.<br><br>You're amazing.<br><br>Wait, be careful.<br><br>That woman isn't playing<br>with a full deck.<br><br>According to our records,<br><br>you and Ms. Deidre Love<br>conspired against Mr.

talk.<br><br>In my office, now.<br><br>That doesn't matter.<br><br>Look, we should be already<br>on the next single.<br><br>Hell, the next three singles.<br><br>Tammy is a star.<br><br>The industry

responsible<br>enough to have a key to mine.<br><br>I mean, ours.<br><br>You have two houses now.<br><br>Where you going?<br><br>Out of my way.<br><br>I can't stand to be in this<br>house around you anymore.<br><br>Because of an unknown number?<br><br>Do I really look this stupid?<br><br>Do I?<br><br>Let's talk about this.<br><br>You know, why is<br>it the only time<br><br>you're willing

just been a lot.<br><br>Girl, it's gonna be okay.<br><br>But what's really going on?<br><br>Well, Charles is<br>staying at a hotel,<br><br>and Jay is with Deidra.<br><br>Oh Tam, your husband is famous.<br><br>And with the hit new song,<br><br>all his ex's will probably<br>come out of the woodwork.<br><br>Well, he needs to<br>get ahead of that.<br><br>It is not my job<br>to manage his

all of that.<br><br>But I have a hard time with<br>one part of your story.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>He knew your address.<br><br>Photos were taken of you.<br><br>Text messages.<br><br>Yeah, they were all fake.<br><br>I'm trying to tell<br>y'all, it's Deidra.<br><br>I have never used an app<br>like that before in my life.<br><br>But this man had a key.<br><br>Was that also fake?<br><br>The alarm wasn't on.<br><br>Is there a reason for that?<br><br>Because it's a safe<br>damn neighborhood.<br><br>This, whatever this is, is over.<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>Excuse me, I'm Pam<br>Newman, I'm her attorney.<br><br>I'm taking a statement.<br><br>Sounds to me like<br>you already have it.<br><br>I'm collecting facts.<br><br>Well, let me tell you<br>one fact you do know.<br><br>A man broke into the home.<br><br>No, he entered<br>the home with a key.<br><br>And attacked my client<br>and she defended herself,<br><br>which is her right.<br><br>So if you're not sure what you<br>need from my client, leave.<br><br>And call me when<br>you make a decision.<br><br>We'll be in touch.<br><br>You don't speak with<br>no one without me again.<br><br>Do you hear me?<br><br>I'm not going to let<br>anything happen to you.<br><br>It's gonna be okay.<br><br>Tammy?<br><br>Oh baby, are you okay?<br><br>I tried calling you.<br><br>Oh, I know.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>How are you?<br><br>Detectives<br>think I invited him in.<br><br>Look, baby, I don't want you<br>to worry about any of that.<br><br>We're going to take care of<br>it, I promise, all right?<br><br>You need to get her out of here.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>The media catches wind of<br>this it's gonna be a circus.<br><br>Can we take your car?<br><br>Yes, but we're going to<br>need to make a statement.<br><br>I'm, I'm on it.<br><br>We need something now<br><br>before someone else<br>creates the narrative.<br><br>I'll figure it out.<br><br>No, I'll handle it.<br><br>You just get her as far<br>away from here as possible.<br><br>I know a team that can<br>clean up the crime scene<br><br>while we're away.<br><br>Just stop, stop.<br><br>I'm not leaving.<br><br>We can't stay here.<br><br>So what, I'm supposed<br>to go out there?<br><br>You think that's gonna<br>bring me peace of mind?<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>This is not a crime scene.<br><br>This is our home and I<br>will not be run away.<br><br>Someone was in here.<br><br>Now we need to think<br>smart about this<br><br>until I can hire<br>a security team.<br><br>I mean, what if there's<br>another deranged fan out there?<br><br>This wasn't a fan.<br><br>It was Deidre.<br><br>Deidra?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Look, the pictures<br>were all fake.<br><br>Yes, it was my face,<br>but it was not my body.<br><br>That doesn't mean it was her.<br><br>Crazy fans make fake<br>photos all the time.<br><br>What about the call?<br><br>You didn't hear her voice.<br><br>Yeah, but my bangle<br>and, and, and lingerie.<br><br>It was missing.<br>Tammy.<br><br>So y'all think I'm crazy.<br><br>No, but we can't rock<br>the boat with Deidre<br><br>or anyone right now.<br><br>And making accusations we<br>can't prove can backfire on us.<br><br>You're a person of<br>interest in a crime.<br><br>A crime that could<br>sent you to jail<br><br>for the rest of your<br>natural black life.<br><br>If Deidre is behind this,<br><br>tipping her off right now<br>that you suspect something<br><br>isn't going to help.<br><br>So what, huh?<br><br>What, you, you, you saying<br>I should do nothing?<br><br>I'm saying let me do my job.<br><br>Let, let us fix this, all right?<br><br>Let me worry about Jay and<br>we'll get through this together.<br><br>All right?<br>Mmhm.<br><br>It's gonna be okay.<br><br>She's doing okay.<br><br>Tonight was a difficult night.<br><br>Tammy is resting comfortably<br><br>surrounded by the<br>people who love her.<br><br>Tammy's not only a celebrity,<br><br>but she's a loving<br>wife and mother.<br><br>- You lying bitch.<br>- We ask for privacy<br><br>during this difficult time.<br><br>- Ain't nobody's mother.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>It's a lie.<br><br>Everyone on the internet<br><br>is saying that Tammy<br>killed someone.<br><br>Oh no, it's true, baby.<br><br>I think I need to be with them.<br><br>No, no, you're safe.<br><br>You're safe here with me.<br><br>But Tammy needs me.<br><br>She's always been there for me.<br><br>She needs you?<br><br>She need a God damn lawyer.<br><br>She not thinking<br>about you right now.<br><br>I'm going home.<br><br>You are home.<br><br>No, I'm calling dad.<br><br>He's busy.<br><br>His wife just murdered somebody<br><br>and she's facing jail time<br>for the rest of her life.<br><br>She's not thinking about you.<br><br>You should appreciate the fact<br><br>that I'm trying to<br>keep you here safe.<br><br>You acting just like<br>your damn daddy.<br><br>It's better than<br>acting like you.<br><br>Jay?<br><br>Shit.<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>I'm Detective Fletcher.<br><br>Oh, now is not a<br>good time, Officer.<br><br>What, what's this about?<br><br>Just need to ask<br>a few questions.<br><br>About?<br><br>Are we able to go inside?<br><br>I'm on my way to work.<br><br>That's odd.<br><br>You no longer work there.<br><br>I checked.<br><br>How may I help you?<br><br>It's about your ex-husband.<br><br>Is this about last night?<br><br>I was here with my son,<br><br>and I'm afraid I<br>don't know anything.<br><br>How about I come<br>back at a later time?<br><br>That would be best.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>Go to your room.<br><br>What is that?<br><br>Go to your room.<br><br>Baby, I'm sorry.<br><br>I would never do<br>anything to hurt you.<br><br>What you saw is not<br>what you think you saw.<br><br>And you're right about Tammy.<br><br>She didn't kill anyone.<br><br>What you saw in the room was<br>me trying to help the police.<br><br>They asked me to help.<br><br>I know this is scary,<br><br>but I was just doing<br>my part trying to help.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>They said somebody might<br>be trying to hurt me, too.<br><br>I will never let<br>anything happen to you.<br><br>I'll protect you.<br><br>That's my baby.<br><br>Now what do we do?<br><br>We stick together.<br><br>You and me.<br><br>They've been out<br>there all night.<br><br>I'm working on that.<br><br>I'll get the media to back off.<br><br>It's just, I know<br>Deidre's behind this.<br><br>Anybody with eyes can see that,<br><br>but me having a law agree is<br>advising you to see what I see.<br><br>And what is that?<br><br>The police will subpoena<br>Deidre's internet provider<br><br>for her IP address's activity.<br><br>It'll be all over soon.<br><br>She's done.<br><br>It doesn't feel that way.<br><br>I need a favor,<br>from Detective Pam.<br><br>What do you mean Jay<br>doesn't want to come home?<br><br>No, let me talk to him.<br><br>I tried calling him all night.<br><br>He's not answering his phone.<br><br>Just put him on<br>the phone, Deidre.<br><br>What?<br><br>I don't need to calm down.<br><br>What?<br><br>You can't do that.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Deidre.<br><br>Damn it!<br><br>How long you been<br>standing there?<br><br>Long enough.<br><br>Go, you need to see him.<br><br>I'm, I'm not leaving you.<br><br>I am not a porcelain doll.<br><br>Jay needs you, go check on him.<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>We're leaving.<br><br>Wait, he, wait.<br><br>He wants to stay.<br><br>I don't have time for this.<br><br>Jay, Jay.<br>Calm down, calm down.<br><br>Look, I'm not letting you<br>in here until you calm down.<br><br>We are going to speak as adults.<br><br>That boy is scared<br>enough as it is already.<br><br>How did you get these so fast?<br><br>I don't disclose my techniques.<br><br>Wow they look so real.<br><br>It's a deep fake.<br><br>She's crazier than I thought.<br><br>Yeah, but why?<br><br>Charles was open to having<br>her be in Jay's life.<br><br>I just...<br><br>Something must<br>have triggered her.<br><br>It's the prettiest song<br>that I've ever heard.<br><br>I feel like I have a,<br>a connection to it.<br><br>You know what?<br><br>Let me call you back.<br><br>Are you really gonna<br>keep me from my son?<br><br>What the hell are<br>you doing, Deidra?<br><br>What am I doing?<br><br>Uh, someone was<br>killed in your house,<br><br>and you really want<br>him to go back to that?<br><br>Then we'll leave.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>He'll love that.<br><br>Another move in the<br>middle of the school year.<br><br>And let me guess, being with<br>you was the only solution?<br><br>Last time I checked, no<br>one died in my living room.<br><br>Jay is a child.<br><br>He needs time to process.<br><br>He's safer here.<br><br>He's safe with me.<br><br>That's not good enough for me.<br><br>Not good enough, for you?<br><br>I'm doing what's<br>best for my son.<br><br>By brainwashing him against me?<br><br>Last time I saw your wife,<br><br>she was leaving with a suitcase,<br><br>and the next day<br>she's killing someone.<br><br>Your house is unstable,<br><br>and it's been like<br>that for a minute.<br><br>I'd be happy to talk to the<br>press about my concerns.<br><br>Oh, so this<br>is what it comes down to?<br><br>Okay, let's cut the bullshit.<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>I want our son safe.<br><br>I'm looking out for him.<br><br>Someone has to and clearly<br>Tammy can't do that.<br><br>This isn't about Tammy.<br><br>This is about you and me.<br><br>You made it about Tammy<br>when you gave her our song.<br><br>Song?<br><br>What, what, what are<br>you talking about?<br><br>You're crazy.<br><br>And your wife is a killer.<br><br>You sure know how to<br>pick 'em, Charles.<br><br>♪ Love me right, love<br>me right, do me right ♪<br><br>♪ Why do you, hold me tight,<br>never lie, you're right ♪<br><br>♪ You and I<br><br>♪ You and I, you and I<br><br>♪ You and I, you and I<br><br>I'm not leaving without my son.<br><br>Can I at least<br>collect his things<br><br>and explain to him<br>why he has to go?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Wait here.<br><br>Hey, is everything okay?<br><br>Charles, Deidre sang<br>the demo for "You and I?"<br><br>No, I mean, yeah, yeah.<br><br>Look, it's complicated.<br><br>Uncomplicate it for me.<br><br>Tammy, it's not what you think.<br><br>Enough with the cryptic talk.<br><br>Look, all right,<br><br>we played around with the<br>song in the studio once,<br><br>like 13 years ago.<br><br>It wasn't for a demo, right?<br><br>It was for us.<br><br>We were just being<br>silly, it was nothing.<br><br>Yeah, but it was<br>everything to Deidre.<br><br>You know, in her mind, she<br>thinks that I'm singing her song.<br><br>The song that you<br>wrote for her family.<br><br>The family that<br>I'm a part of now.<br><br>Look, I didn't expect-<br><br>- I told you to promise me<br><br>that you would always be<br>honest with me about your past.<br><br>And here I am finding out<br>another secret you hid from me.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Your sorry's are starting to<br>become meaningless, Charles.<br><br>Let me know when you<br>and Jay are on the way.<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>Damn.<br><br>Jay, let's go.<br><br>Is dad mad?<br><br>No, but we're leaving, let's go.<br><br>Where to?<br><br>I don't have time to<br>answer any of your questions.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Just leave it.<br><br>But what about dad?<br><br>Boy, you'll be with<br>your dad soon, I promise.<br><br>The police tracked<br>the IP address back to Deidra.<br><br>An arrest warrant<br>has been issued.<br><br>They're on their way now.<br><br>So it's over.<br><br>When she's arrested,<br><br>I'll issue a press release and<br>you can rebuild your family,<br><br>and all of this will be over.<br><br>I'm gonna call Charles,<br>but I love you, sis.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>I love you, too.<br><br>Tammy?<br><br>Charles?<br><br>Baby, you don't sound too good.<br><br>Charles, speak to me.<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I think, I think Deidra hit me.<br><br>What?<br><br>She's lost her mind.<br><br>Okay, are, are you okay?<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Jay?<br><br>Jay?!<br><br>Charles, what is going on?<br><br>She has Jay.<br><br>Call the police, now.<br><br>How is your burger?<br><br>Why are we here?<br><br>There's a lot of people that<br>don't wanna see us together.<br><br>And Miss Pam is a lawyer<br>and she's gonna help us.<br><br>Then why don't we just<br>go to Aunt Pam's house?<br><br>I know where it is from here.<br><br>It's too dangerous.<br><br>She's gonna meet us here.<br><br>It's been over an hour.<br><br>How much longer do we<br>have to sit out here for?<br><br>You know I love you, right?<br><br>And I would never let<br>anything or anyone hurt you.<br><br>I refuse to let that happen.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Mommy's gonna go<br>away for a while.<br><br>I'm coming with you.<br><br>No, not this time.<br><br>But you said it yourself.<br><br>I need to protect you.<br><br>And you have done<br>a wonderful job.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>It's not important.<br><br>But what is important<br><br>is that we got a chance to<br>spend some time together.<br><br>Okay, mom.<br><br>She's waking up.<br><br>Could you go get a nurse?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Where am I?<br><br>There's been an accident.<br><br>- I got it.<br>- Relax.<br><br>I don't remember anything.<br><br>Deidre's behind this.<br><br>I know she is.<br><br>She's desperate.<br><br>She took Jay and ran, she's,<br><br>you know, I'm afraid to think<br>of what she's even capable of.<br><br>You don't remember anything?<br><br>I can't remember.<br><br>I wish I could remember<br>anything to bury the bitch.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>How do you feel?<br><br>I'm okay.<br><br>Okay, careful.<br><br>So there's<br>nothing more you can do?<br><br>Sir, we're doing all we can.<br><br>All you can?<br><br>My wife told you<br><br>that Deidra was behind<br>us from the beginning.<br><br>If you had arrested her, none<br>of this would be happening.<br><br>That's not the way<br>it works, Mr. Harper.<br><br>I understand your frustration.<br><br>Do you?<br><br>Because I don't think you do.<br><br>My son is missing.<br><br>Someone is in the hospital.<br><br>I was almost killed and<br>my wife was attacked.<br><br>You don't understand shit.<br><br>Should I answer it?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Put it on speaker.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Do we have an audience?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Take me off speaker, just you.<br><br>Look, I need to hear everything.<br><br>I will tell you everything.<br><br>Just please let me handle this.<br><br>This could be our only chance.<br><br>Just keep her on the phone<br>for as long as you can.<br><br>Are you there?<br><br>Um, yeah, I'm, I'm here.<br><br>Jay wants to talk to you<br><br>and I want this to be over.<br><br>Is he safe?<br><br>Let's just end this.<br><br>Woman to woman, just you and me.<br><br>If you do anything stupid,<br><br>you won't ever get<br>to see Jay again.<br><br>Get rid of

I know how tired you<br>get after each flight.<br><br>You have a job that is<br>emotionally and physically taxing.<br><br>I always felt bad about it.<br><br>I want to live near the airport<br>to make things easier for you.<br><br>My gosh, I'm so touched.<br><br>But isn't that area pretty expensive?<br><br>There's something I haven't told you yet.<br><br>When my mother passed away,<br><br>I inherited a small house<br>that was under her name.<br><br>If I sell that house and use my savings,<br><br>I should be able to pay the deposit<br>without taking out a loan.<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>Why didn't you tell me about that house?<br><br>Well...<br><br>If you used to live there with your mother,<br><br>why did you move out?<br><br>Well, the house is old.<br><br>So the heating doesn't work properly.<br><br>And there's no subway station nearby.<br><br>Where is it?<br><br>I'd say it's about a<br>15-minute walk from my place?<br><br>Min-su.<br><br>I thought we knew<br>everything about each other.<br><br>But you kept such an<br>important thing from me.<br><br>It hurts my feelings a little.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>I just realized that<br>there's something I never told you.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>"JUNG SEONG-GYEONG"<br><br>What is this?<br><br>My allergy medication.<br><br>My entire family is allergic to dog saliva.<br><br>When I come in contact with dog saliva,<br><br>my throat swells up to the point<br>that I can't breathe.<br><br>So you had to take this<br>every time we met up?<br><br>Only when Runie was there.<br><br>You said Runie helped you find solace<br><br>after your mother passed away.<br><br>Runie is your family, so I didn't<br>want you to worry about my allergy.<br><br>But if we get married and<br>start living together...<br><br>I can't take those pills every day.<br><br>We'll have a baby someday, you know.<br><br>Babe.<br><br>Don't worry.<br><br>Everyone in my family loves Runie.<br><br>If I ask them, they'll<br>be happy to take him.<br><br>Are you sure they'll be okay with it?<br><br>Yes, they take care of him for me<br>from time to time anyway.<br><br>Babe, I'll make sure...<br><br>you won't have to take this again.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Is it not possible to<br>get rid of the allergy?<br><br>Dog saliva has a few types of<br>proteins that can cause allergies.<br><br>But they can't be cured since<br>allergies are hereditary.<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>There's a simple solution.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Don't get married.<br><br>I'm serious right now.<br><br>Goodness. Okay, all right.<br><br>Min-su, don't worry.<br><br>You have me.<br><br>I'll help you.<br><br>But who in the family can look after Runie?<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Our second aunt won't be able to take him<br>since her husband recently quit his job.<br><br>And our youngest aunt is out of the<br>question because Ji-ho is taking the CSAT.<br><br>What about Uncle?<br><br>Has he looked after Runie before?<br><br>He hasn't?<br><br>No! Aunt was bitten by a dog once,<br>so she's afraid of big dogs.<br><br>Runie never bites people.<br><br>Come on! That's what you think.<br><br>When you're traumatized<br>by an experience like that,<br><br>even seeing something similar<br>makes you freeze instinctively.<br><br>Hey, is there a reason<br>it has to be someone in the family?<br><br>Because I won't be able<br>to trust the person otherwise.<br><br>It doesn't have to be a family member.<br>You can find a good person you can trust.<br><br>But how?<br><br>Post on Instagram that you're looking<br>for someone to adopt Runie.<br><br>On Instagram?<br><br>Many people do that these days.<br><br>But I can't use my account because<br>Seong-gyeong follows me on Instagram.<br><br>I told her someone in the family<br>would be happy to take Runie.<br><br>Hey, you're on Instagram?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Why didn't you tell me?<br><br>You never asked.<br><br>Whatever. How many followers do you have?<br><br>My follower count has probably gone up.<br><br>Let's see. 30 followers.<br><br>Gosh! Are you serious?<br>You've got to be kidding me.<br><br>- That's like nothing.<br>- Huh?<br><br>What?

I was born in 1978.<br><br>My life's just beginning now.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Look at all these wrinkles here.<br><br>- How will you begin your life...<br>- Why you little!<br><br>- Jeez, seriously.<br>- Okay, fine.<br><br>But can you really trust someone<br>you met on Instagram?<br><br>I'm sure some are trustworthy,<br>and some are not.<br><br>Talk to them in person and find out.<br><br>You never know.<br><br>When do you need to rehome Runie by?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I'm not even sure if it's<br>the right thing to do.<br><br>It's just a matter of<br>finding the right person.<br><br>If you find someone who will<br>love Runie as much as you do,<br><br>you won't feel so bad about it.<br><br>Hey, let's just take one step at a time.<br><br>Let's post on my Instagram<br><br>and see if we can find someone<br>who wants to adopt Runie.<br><br>You can rehome him<br>if you find someone you really like.<br><br>If that doesn't happen,<br>we'll look for another solution.<br><br>We have no idea how long it would take,<br>so let's start soon.<br><br>Okay, I think that's a good plan.<br><br>Then how much will you pay me for the ad?<br><br>- "Ad"?<br>- Hey, think about it.<br><br>I have 30,000 followers.<br><br>When an influencer like me<br>puts on an advertisement,<br><br>it's obvious I need to<br>be compensated for it.<br><br>When did you become such a jerk?<br><br>Why are you calling me a jerk?<br><br>So many companies DM me for ad inquiries.<br><br>Come on. You only have<br>30,000 followers, not 300,000.<br><br>No way.<br><br>It's not like I'm asking for a huge sum.<br><br>Hey, I'm dirt broke right now,<br><br>and my screen is all cracked.<br><br>When I'm on the phone,<br>the shards dig into my skin.<br><br>I'm asking you to help me get this<br>replaced, and you call me a jerk?<br><br>Quiet down.<br><br>Whatever! I don't care. Just help me out!<br><br>You're that broke?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Okay, fine.<br><br>If you find someone who'll adopt Runie,<br>I'll get you a new screen.<br><br>I'll do my best, sir.<br><br>Bow to me politely.<br><br>I'm sorry I got home so late.<br><br>If I can't find someone<br>who will think of you as their family,<br><br>I won't send you anywhere, so don't worry.<br><br>I promise.<br><br>My phone's blowing up.<br><br>Being an influencer sure isn't easy.<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Who's this?<br><br>"HELLO! IT'S ME, PARK MI-SUN!"<br><br>Oh, it's Mi-sun. I<br>trained her a while back.<br><br>Her husband is good-looking.<br><br>Right? He's very handsome.<br><br>I know. He kind of looks like me<br>when I was younger.<br><br>Who does the baby take after?<br><br>He just fell asleep.<br><br>- Thank you for coming.<br>- Of course.<br><br>No problem at all.<br><br>Let me explain our situation.<br><br>I read in a book<br>that kids who grow up with dogs<br><br>have stronger immune systems<br>and tend to be a lot more sociable.<br><br>My husband and I have decided<br>to have only one kid.<br><br>So we kept wondering if we should get a dog<br>to make sure our kid wouldn't feel lonely.<br><br>Then I saw your post on Instagram.<br><br>- Runie, right?<br>- Yes.<br><br>He's so cute!<br><br>"PARK SEONG-JIN"<br><br>Why is this person calling me?<br><br>You must put your phone on vibrate<br>in theaters and around babies.<br><br>You have no manners.<br><br>You'll never become an agent of Kingsman.<br><br>"Kingsman"? That's so random.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>It's okay. No worries.<br><br>Why don't we sit closer?<br><br>Because of my baby.<br><br>Is anyone in your family allergic to dogs?<br><br>Dog saliva has a few types of proteins<br>that can cause allergies.<br><br>If you were born allergic to dogs,<br>it can't be cured.<br><br>Don't worry. Once, a friend of mine<br>brought her dog to our place,<br><br>and the baby was fine.<br><br>- I'm glad to hear that.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>It seems like you both<br>think it'll work out,<br><br>so why don't we meet Runie together?<br><br>- Sounds good!<br>- Great.<br><br>Then let's...<br><br>Darn it.<br><br>Turn off the barking!<br><br>"ORDER RUNIE'S FOOD" Darn it.<br><br>I'm sorry, baby.<br><br>You'll never become a<br>Kingsman agent either.<br><br>- Hey, did you not eat breakfast?<br>- Why?<br><br>Your breath smells like poop.<br><br>Only jerks attack others' weaknesses.<br><br>Quiet!<br><br>Can you both put your<br>phones on silent mode?<br><br>So when can I meet Runie?<br><br>If you have some time today...<br><br>Where are your manners?<br><br>Enough is enough!<br><br>Sorry to interrupt<br>while you're letting out your anger.<br><br>You'd better be.<br><br>Looks like your mother-in-law<br>needs to speak to you.<br><br>"MOTHER-IN-LAW"<br><br>Let's talk another time.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Hey, let's go.<br><br>Put on the guest slippers.<br><br>Oh, sure.<br><br>Getting a golden retriever<br>has always been my dream.<br><br>Overseas, you see cool people<br>walking their golden retrievers.<br><br>I wanted to become successful<br>and go for walks with my golden retriever.<br><br>I have a company that sells chicken breasts,<br>and it finally made it big last year.<br><br>Well, not that big. Our last year's revenue<br>was over 8 million dollars.<br><br>- This is my living room.<br>- Whoa.<br><br>Wow, look at that!<br><br>It's just a humble abode,<br>perfect for a single guy.<br><br>- Hey, you must've hit the jackpot!<br>- Gosh, no.<br><br>No, wait!<br><br>Hold on a second.<br><br>What's he doing?<br><br>Don't move.<br><br>What's wrong? What is it?<br><br>I'm a bit of a neat freak.<br><br>Gosh, you're covered in dog hair.<br><br>You know that<br>golden retrievers shed a lot, right?<br><br>Really?<br><br>Especially during shedding seasons.<br><br>One touch, and your hand will be covered.<br><br>Will you be okay with that?<br><br>Is there a golden retriever<br>that doesn't shed?<br><br>Have you seen a short-necked giraffe?<br><br>Come on. How can a<br>giraffe have a short neck?<br><br>I'm trying to tell you that<br>all golden retrievers shed.<br><br>Oh, I see.<br><br>But I don't appreciate<br>the way you just said it.<br><br>Then shall I be more direct?<br><br>Yeah, be direct.<br><br>A dog isn't a decorative object.<br><br>Don't get a dog until you're<br>ready to truly love it.<br><br>Hey...<br><br>I'll see you another time.<br><br>Are you sure we can find someone this way?<br><br>It's because they've never<br>had a dog in their lives.<br><br>The person we'll meet<br>next used to have a dog.<br><br>A golden retriever, just like Runie.<br><br>Really? Who is this person?<br><br>One of the regulars at my old café.<br><br>The thing is though, his<br>dog died from cancer.<br><br>Sang-ho.<br><br>Sang-ho?<br><br>Hey, pass me your phone for a sec.<br>I want to show you something.<br><br>You have your phone.<br><br>The glass dust will get on my fingers.<br>Just hand it over.<br><br>- Don't go through my albums.<br>- Why would I go through your photos?<br><br>Here.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>These dogs look so happy.<br>Their tails are perked up.<br><br>The under-eye area looks so clean.<br><br>Looks like the owner<br>takes great care of them.<br><br>Do you know this person?<br><br>No. I couldn't fall asleep last night.<br><br>So I was browsing on Instagram,<br>and this account popped up.<br><br>But this person lives in Jeju Island.<br><br>That's too far.<br><br>Gosh, I'm sorry.<br>I don't think he'll come down.<br><br>He's going through puberty,<br>so he's on edge these days.<br><br>No worries. We understand.<br><br>When did your dog pass away?<br><br>It's already been over a month.<br><br>But he's having a hard time accepting it.<br><br>I get it though.<br><br>We adopted him from a shelter<br>when Sang-ho was four<br><br>and lived with him for ten years.<br><br>My gosh, no wonder he's<br>still so devastated.<br><br>I thought adopting a similar dog<br>would help him, so I brought it up,<br><br>but he got so upset with me.<br><br>Then I happened to see<br>your post on Instagram.<br><br>He was a regular at my old café.<br><br>Oh, really?<br><br>I love the pour-over<br>coffee that Jin-guk makes.<br><br>I make great pour-over coffee.<br><br>What?<br><br>Anyway,<br><br>I was so surprised when I saw that post.<br><br>Min-su, our dogs almost look identical.<br><br>- My gosh!<br>- I do see a bit of resemblance.<br><br>Not just a bit.<br><br>They look like twins.<br><br>See this part where the hair has<br>turned white? Even that's identical.<br><br>Min-su, how about you go upstairs<br><br>and talk to Sang-ho about it?<br><br>You love dogs and have had Runie for years,<br><br>so I'm sure the two of you<br>can relate to each other.<br><br>Oh, good point.<br><br>Shall I try?<br><br>Yes, you should.<br><br>All right. I'll go see<br>if I can talk to him.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- I'll be right back.<br><br>Dad, leave me alone!<br><br>Hi, Sang-ho. My name is Min-su.<br><br>I'm your dad's acquaintance.<br>Can I come in for a minute?<br><br>Why do you need to come in?<br><br>I have a golden retriever, too.<br>His name is Runie.<br><br>What's your dog's name?<br><br>Jung-ho.<br><br>I see, Jung-ho.<br><br>That sounds like a person's name.<br><br>Did you come up with the name?<br><br>Yes, both our names end with "Ho".<br><br>Because he's my little brother.<br><br>I see. I guess you have no siblings.<br><br>Not anymore.<br><br>I'm an only child too.<br><br>So I was very lonely as well<br>when I was growing up.<br><br>You were probably not lonely at all<br>when Jung-ho was around.<br><br>Right.<br><br>I know what it's like.<br><br>But you see, Sang-ho...<br><br>I heard all dogs go to heaven.<br><br>I'm sure Jung-ho is in heaven now,<br>watching over you even at this very moment.<br><br>So if you're this devastated,<br><br>Jung-ho will be very sad, don't you think?<br><br>He'd want to console<br>you right by your side,<br><br>but he can't do that now.<br><br>You don't want Jung-ho to be sad, right?<br><br>I don't want him to be sad.<br><br>Sang-ho.<br><br>I want to show you something.<br>Can I come in for a minute?<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Oh, here. This is my dog.<br><br>Jung-ho!<br><br>It's not Jung-ho. He's my dog, Runie.<br><br>What the hell are you talking about?<br><br>Oh, I mean... He's not Sang-ho.<br><br>What I'm saying is, he's not Jung-ho.<br><br>No! This is my dog.<br><br>Sang-ho, this is my dog, Runie.<br><br>No, this is Jung-ho. It's my dog.<br><br>No, he's my dog.<br><br>He's my dog!<br><br>Runie is my dog, you little brat!<br><br>Jung-ho is my dog, you little brat!<br><br>- He's my dog.<br>- I said, he's mine!<br><br>- He's my dog.<br>- No, he's my dog.<br><br>- He's mine!<br>- No, he's mine!<br><br>- No, he's mine.<br>- My dog!<br><br>- No!<br>- No!<br><br>He's my dog!<br><br>Who's this?<br><br>My son. He's learning special martial arts.<br><br>That's very cool.<br><br>He's really good.<br><br>Don't say anything, mister.<br><br>Just don't.<br><br>I mean it. Don't!<br><br>I will kill you!<br><br>He is my dog!<br><br>You little...<br><br>I'm much older than you... Gosh!<br><br>- That doesn't matter.<br>- It went everywhere. My wife...<br><br>- Sang-ho.<br>- Get him out of there.<br><br>What's he talking about?<br><br>Huh? Hey! What happened...<br><br>Gosh, I get that he's tired,<br>but how could he fall asleep here?<br><br>Hey, I told you to persuade the kid.<br>Why are you sleeping here?<br><br>My dog...<br><br>I thought you were sleeping.<br><br>I'm not crazy. Why would I<br>fall asleep in a stranger's house?<br><br>Right, you're not that crazy.<br><br>Anyway, what do you think?<br>Aren't they the best candidate?<br><br>I'm not sure.<br><br>They live close to you,<br>and they used to have a golden retriever.<br><br>There are different levels of compatibility<br>between dogs and their owners.<br><br>I don't think they're compatible.<br><br>- Why not?<br>- Think about it.<br><br>Sang-ho will expect Runie<br>to act exactly like Jung-ho.<br><br>But Runie is Runie. He's not Jung-ho.<br><br>Runie has his own likes and dislikes,<br><br>but Sang-ho won't understand that.<br><br>Then Runie and Jung-ho...<br><br>I mean, neither Runie nor<br>Sang-ho will be happy.<br><br>Hey, didn't you say<br>you put this place up for sale?<br><br>Yeah, but it hasn't sold yet,<br>so I'm still waiting on it.<br><br>But that window is open.<br><br>Hey, it's so dusty in here.<br><br>I'll go upstairs quickly<br>and close the window.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>Mom...<br><br>Mom, wait.<br><br>Just a moment.<br><br>Mom, please... Just a moment.<br><br>Mom, no...<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Runie...<br><br>Runie...<br><br>Runie.<br><br>I didn't even get to say goodbye to Mom.<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>Runie...<br><br>After I graduated from college,<br><br>I wanted to win the literary contest<br>and become a novelist.<br><br>I wasn't even earning a single penny,<br><br>but I whined to my mom every day<br>about how stressed out I was.<br><br>I did that for four years.<br><br>All the stress I had caused her...<br><br>became cancer cells...<br><br>and killed her.<br><br>So I told myself...<br><br>that I would never cause<br>pain to those I love again.<br><br>But Seong-gyeong...<br><br>She has been taking<br>medication because of me.<br><br>I had no idea.<br><br>I'm a worthless jerk.<br><br>- Gosh, what a moron.<br>- Hey.<br><br>Hey, you'll hurt yourself. Don't do that.<br><br>Hey, stop it.<br><br>- I should just die!<br>- Min-su.<br><br>Min-su! Hey.<br><br>I'll make sure we find<br>a good new home for Runie,<br><br>and you and Seong-gyeong will<br>get married without any problems.<br><br>So don't cry.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Why are you crying again?<br><br>- My eyes are burning.<br>- What?<br><br>My eyes are burning!<br><br>I can't see anything!<br><br>Excuse me!<br><br>Can we get a clean towelette over here?<br><br>Bye, take care.<br><br>- Get home safely.<br>- Bye!<br><br>- Will do.<br>- Bye.<br><br>- Ouch!<br>- Sorry! I'm sorry, Min-su.<br><br>- I'm heavy, aren't I?<br>- No, not at all.<br><br>I gave you a piggyback ride<br>every day when you were little.<br><br>- How about now?<br>- Hey! Stop kicking.<br><br>Keep your legs still, you brat.<br><br>This isn't because you're heavy.<br><br>It's because I'm drunk now.<br>That's why, okay?<br><br>"MY PUPPY"<br><br>Sorry, I just woke up.<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>I have a headache.<br><br>Do you remember calling me last night<br><br>crying and saying sorry over and over?<br><br>I'm sorry. I drank way too much<br>with Jin-guk last night.<br><br>That's okay.<br><br>But I want you to tell me whenever<br>you're stressed out about something.<br><br>We'll become a family soon, you know.<br><br>A family must overcome<br>challenges and hardships together.<br><br>Don't take it all on yourself.<br><br>Okay, I won't.<br><br>I have to head in now.<br><br>I'll call you when I arrive.<br><br>Okay. Love you, babe.<br><br>Love you more.<br><br>My second uncle lives in Paju,<br>and he has a small garden.<br><br>Right.<br><br>A black dog named Rey lives in that garden.<br><br>That dog kind of looks like Runie,<br><br>but it's a bit smaller<br>and has shorter hair.<br><br>Oh, it must be a Labrador retriever.<br><br>Labrador... I see.<br><br>This is good. You don't want coffee?<br><br>I'm not a fan of these beans.<br><br>Hey, do you think Runie and Rey<br>can become friends?<br><br>Every dog has a different personality.<br><br>So it's hard to tell unless they meet.<br><br>But I have to say, Paju is pretty far.<br><br>I know. But clearly,<br>there are advantages to this option.<br><br>First, he's an experienced retriever owner.<br><br>And Runie and his dog may become friends.<br><br>The pros might outweigh the cons.<br><br>Let's go and see.<br><br>Good boy.<br><br>- Good boy.<br>- Is that like Runie's seat belt?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Runie, play with Rey. Go!<br><br>Go play.<br><br>What do you think?<br>Do you think it'll work out?<br><br>I think they'll become friends soon.<br><br>Would you be willing to send Runie<br>to Uncle if he agreed to adopt him?<br><br>I think he'll be okay here.<br><br>Okay, good.<br><br>Give me a minute.<br><br>Jin-guk.<br><br>Best of luck.<br><br>Thanks. I got this!<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>- Uncle!<br>- Hi, Jin-guk.<br><br>Good to see you.<br><br>What? Did you get your eyebrows tattooed?<br><br>Oh, I asked them to make it last long,<br><br>and they made it look so dark.<br><br>They'll easily last for ten years.<br><br>You think so? That'd be great.<br><br>- Come this way.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Min-jeong's doing well, right?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>She's pregnant with her second child.<br><br>Congratulations.<br><br>Is it a boy or a girl?<br><br>A girl.<br><br>But I think I should go<br>to Boston soon to see her.<br><br>I'll find out more once I get there,<br><br>but Min-jeong has preeclampsia,<br>and it's quite serious.<br><br>Both Min-jeong and her baby<br>may end up in critical condition.<br><br>My wife flew there last week<br>to look after our first grandchild,<br><br>and my flight's next week.<br><br>But I have no idea how long<br>I'll end up staying there.<br><br>I'm thinking six months at the least.<br><br>I may end up staying there<br>a little over a year.<br><br>Then what about Rey?<br>Who will look after him?<br><br>For real?<br><br>That's why I wanted to see you today.<br><br>You're the only person<br>I can trust, you know.<br><br>I'll return as soon as Min-jeong<br>gives birth without any problems.<br><br>Help me out just this once.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Thanks, Jin-guk.<br><br>Don't mention it. You've<br>helped me out so much.<br><br>I should help you, of course.<br><br>Thankfully, my cousin knows<br>a lot about retrievers.<br><br>I'll ask him for help and<br>take good care of Rey.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Thanks a lot.<br><br>No problem.<br><br>By the way, your aunt and I had a talk.<br><br>The money we borrowed<br>you to open that café.<br><br>Do you still owe us 30,000 dollars?<br><br>You don't need to pay us back.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>We didn't say anything because<br>you insisted on paying us back.<br><br>Your aunt said you can just<br>use the money to look after Rey.<br><br>Still, I should pay you back...<br><br>No, you'd better do as I say.<br><br>It'll help us feel more at ease.<br><br>All right, then.<br><br>Gosh, I'm relieved now.<br><br>I bet you knew about it from the get-go.<br><br>Hey! I'd never lie to you.<br><br>You lie to me every day!<br><br>That's not true! Only once in a while.<br><br>You've done this to me many times.<br><br>What will you do now?<br><br>Hey, I'm all flustered too right now.<br><br>Why are you flustered?<br>This is all your fault!<br><br>Okay! Let's cool off for a moment.<br><br>We're going to the riverside park.<br><br>I promised Runie I'd play with him there.<br><br>Runie!<br><br>Come here, Runie!<br><br>Rey, this won't take long. Hold on, okay?<br><br>Doesn't this feel nice?<br><br>"JOO A-MIN"<br>"IN JEJU"<br><br>Why are you so handsome?<br><br>Did you get your good looks from me?<br><br>Let's see. Good boy!<br><br>"MY FAVORITE RED BEAN BUN"<br><br>It feels so nice, doesn't it?<br><br>"Damian"?<br><br>Good boy. We're all done.<br><br>Feels nice, right?<br><br>Damian?<br><br>"DAMIAN"<br>"BAKERY"<br><br>Hey! Rey, where are you going?<br><br>Hey! Runie, get back here!<br><br>God, what a mess!<br><br>We won't find a house in Seoul<br><br>with a garden like A-min's<br>where dogs can run around and play.<br><br>I get that, but we don't<br>know this person at all.<br><br>That's why I'm saying we should meet her.<br><br>You said yourself that<br>the dogs here look happy.<br><br>I think that's a good sign.<br><br>If she loves and cares<br>about her dogs this much,<br><br>she's probably a good<br>person, don't you think?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Let's meet her, okay?<br><br>We can't solve anything by just<br>sitting here and racking our brains.<br><br>If it works out, that's great.<br><br>If it doesn't, we'll find another solution.<br><br>I told you I'd take care<br>of this no matter what.<br><br>Let's go there and meet her.<br><br>When?<br><br>We can go tomorrow.<br><br>Tomorrow? Don't you have to work?<br><br>I can take the day off. What about you?<br><br>I can too, but don't you think<br>we're rushing this too much?<br><br>If I take Rey home now,<br><br>my landlord will kick me out.<br><br>I was just helping you out<br>up until this morning.<br><br>But now, this is an urgent<br>matter to me as well.<br><br>I'm really sorry.<br><br>No, it's okay.<br><br>I was also hoping someone in the family<br>would take care of Runie.<br><br>I think you made the right decision.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>But if we want to fly to Jeju,<br>the dogs will have to fly cargo.<br><br>I don't think Runie can do that<br>because he's afraid of loud noises.<br><br>Then how about a road trip?<br>And we can take the ferry.<br><br>- A road trip?<br>- After you get married,<br><br>we won't really be able<br>to take a trip like this together.<br><br>It'll be nice.<br><br>Let's eat sashimi<br>when we get to Jeju. My treat!<br><br>Then are we going to eat<br>wild-caught longtooth grouper?<br><br>Just eat whatever I buy you.<br><br>Good boy.<br><br>Min-su, what breed is that dog?<br><br>Oh, that's an Afghan hound.<br>That breed is rare in Korea.<br><br>My gosh!<br><br>Wow, what a cool dog.<br><br>Hey, what's your name?<br><br>Careful, you'll drop your phone.<br><br>Hey! What did I say?<br><br>Jin-guk, your screen is all cracked anyway.<br><br>Just get a new phone, okay?<br><br>- Min-su.<br>- Yeah?<br><br>It's rare for me to apologize<br>to anyone this sincerely.<br><br>I'm really sorry!<br><br>For what?<br><br>- Hold on. Hey!<br>- This is unbelievable.<br><br>Hey! It's already shattered!<br><br>- I saw it!<br>- Shut up!<br><br>Okay! I'll shut up!<br><br>Damn you!<br><br>If you see it, you'll just get more upset.<br><br>- Hey, calm down. It can't be undone.<br>- Damn it!<br><br>Why did you use my phone?<br><br>I can't see anything on mine.<br><br>- Hand it over.<br>- Why?<br><br>- I'm going to smash it.<br>- Mine's already smashed.<br><br>Just hand it over!<br><br>You're so dead!<br><br>- What's wrong? What is it?<br>- Runie.<br><br>What is it? What's the matter, Runie?<br><br>What did you see?<br><br>Gosh! Hey, look!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>- My gosh.<br>- What do we do?<br><br>What kind of a lunatic<br>abandoned these puppies here?<br><br>Hey, can you see<br>if there's an animal shelter nearby?<br><br>My gosh.<br><br>"PUREUN ANIMAL SHELTER"<br><br>Hello.<br><br>They've been weaned.<br><br>Looks like they were fed this morning.<br><br>Would you be able to keep them here?<br><br>I'm sorry, but we're filled to capacity<br>at the moment.<br><br>You'll have to find another shelter.<br><br>Where should I take them?<br><br>I'll be honest.<br><br>People rarely adopt mixed-breed dogs.<br><br>So even if you take<br>them to another shelter,<br><br>they'll most likely end up being put down.<br><br>You mean they'll be euthanized?<br><br>Last year, we had a cocker spaniel<br>that was pregnant.<br><br>So I posted on social media that we<br>were expecting cocker spaniel puppies,<br><br>and so many people were interested<br>in adopting them.<br><br>But when the puppies were born,<br><br>I realized they were mixed-breeds.<br><br>When people found out about it,<br>they all changed their minds.<br><br>I mean, I get it.<br><br>But all living beings are precious.<br>How could they...<br><br>Anyway, that cocker<br>spaniel had five puppies.<br><br>I held out for as long as I could<br>to get them adopted.<br><br>But the holding period came to an end,<br><br>so I had to put them down.<br><br>All five of them?<br><br>The mother too.<br><br>To be honest,<br><br>we have some puppies<br>that came in with their moms.<br><br>I have no idea what will happen to them.<br><br>Do you know if there are<br>any shelters in the area<br><br>where the situation is a little better?<br><br>It's probably all the same, more or less.<br><br>Why did you bring them back?<br><br>She said all of them would die<br>if we leave them here.<br><br>Don't they look after abandoned dogs here?<br><br>Yes, they do.<br><br>But mixed-breeds rarely get adopted,<br>so they all get put down in the end.<br><br>Even so, you can't just bring them back.<br><br>What are we going to do with them?<br><br>That person in Jeju<br>might agree to take them.<br><br>But we won't find out until we get there.<br><br>What if she says no?<br><br>Just take them back.<br><br>But how...<br><br>I can't do it. I feel as though<br>I'm the one killing them.<br><br>I guess this master<br>negotiator should step in.<br><br>It was on my way home.<br><br>I suddenly heard a dog cry,<br>so I ran over there.<br><br>A dog was hung on a tree,<br>getting beaten up by those men.<br><br>My goodness.<br><br>I kicked them all out<br>and got him down from the tree,<br><br>but his ribs were all broken already.<br><br>He could barely breathe.<br><br>But I guess he remembered me<br>feeding him a few times in the past.<br><br>When he saw me, he<br>started wagging his tail.<br><br>Had I come to his rescue sooner,<br>he wouldn't have died that day.<br><br>That experience traumatized me,<br><br>so I thought I should<br>do something, anything.<br><br>That's why I started taking in<br>abandoned dogs one by one.<br><br>And ten years have passed since then.<br><br>As the number of dogs grew,<br>people started sending donations.<br><br>At the moment, we have about 200 dogs.<br><br>But we still need a lot of things.<br><br>Most importantly, we<br>don't have enough space.<br><br>So we have no choice<br><br>but to put down the ones<br>that have been here the longest.<br><br>That dog too. They'll pick him up<br>at one to put him down.<br><br>When we found him abandoned,<br><br>we noticed that he had been declawed.<br><br>What? Why?<br><br>Some people who live in apartments...<br><br>declaw their dogs because<br>of the noise they hear<br><br>when their dogs scratch the floor.<br><br>What? But isn't that really painful?<br><br>Yes, it hurts a lot.<br><br>They at least shouldn't abandon them<br>after doing such a thing.<br><br>Gosh, I feel so bad for them.<br><br>Would you like to hold him?<br><br>Oh, sure.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>Good boy. You're so sweet.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Why is he suddenly making<br>that snoring sound?<br><br>Because he's excited.<br><br>He's so happy that someone's holding him.<br><br>Gosh. Don't cry, buddy.<br><br>Hey, you're so excited.<br><br>He seems very happy.<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Since you're all white,<br>I'll call you Baeksuk.<br><br>And you. Let's see.<br><br>My gosh, you kind of look like Jin-guk.<br><br>Then you can be Enemy.<br><br>Sorry, not Enemy. Guk... Guksu?<br><br>How about Guksu?<br><br>She gave me some food for the puppies.<br><br>Some leashes too.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>What? We should get going.<br><br>What's that under your shirt?<br><br>Didn't you say you were<br>a master negotiator?<br><br>Hey, look at this cutie.<br><br>Don't you want to know what his name is?<br><br>No, I don't.<br><br>His name is Thor, the son of Odin.<br><br>The God of Thunder. Loki's stepbrother.<br><br>He was supposed to be put down<br>at one, so I had no choice!<br><br>And having one more dog now<br>won't even make a difference.<br><br>You're in no position to yell at me now!<br><br>This little guy loves me.<br><br>He kept doing that, so what was I<br>supposed to do? Just let him die?<br><br>You brought four! I only brought one.<br><br>Is that important now?<br><br>Hey, we have to persuade<br>A-min no matter what.<br><br>Otherwise, these dogs are all screwed.<br><br>Okay. I'll get on my knees<br>if I have to, so don't worry.<br><br>You'd better.<br><br>I'll do it if I have to.<br><br>Get on your knees as soon as you meet her.<br><br>Can we get going?<br><br>"AIRBNB"<br><br>"AIRBNB"<br><br>Feels nice, right?<br><br>Hey, the coffee we had yesterday...<br><br>I use the same beans every day,<br><br>but it definitely tasted different<br>when you brewed it.<br><br>It was really cool.<br><br>The bean determines only 50 percent<br>of the taste of your coffee.<br><br>The other 50 percent is<br>determined by the barista.<br><br>I really hope you can open<br>another café down the road.<br><br>I bet that one will go bust too.<br><br>That's because<br>you refused to sell iced Americanos.<br><br>During the colder months,<br>you made up to 10,000 dollars monthly.<br><br>You see, I didn't want it to be<br>just like any other cafés.<br><br>I wanted to specialize in pour-over coffee.<br><br>The pour-over method<br><br>brings out all the flavors<br>and aromas of the beans.<br><br>Adding ice to that is like<br><br>locking down the aromas and flavors<br>that I worked hard to bring out.<br><br>Does that make sense to you?<br><br>But still, people want iced Americanos.<br><br>I don't want to compromise.<br><br>Pour-over coffee is my dream,<br>and I believe in it.<br><br>Hey, I worked so hard<br>in that sweat-filled basement gym<br><br>for over ten years,<br>selling my conscience and soul,<br><br>but I really don't want to sell my dream.<br><br>If I give up and even sell that,<br>I'll have no reason to exist.<br><br>I'll be nothing, really.<br><br>I brought it up because you look happy<br>when you're making coffee.<br><br>- Oh, gosh.<br>- My goodness.<br><br>- Here, have some.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Have fun.<br><br>Thank you for this!<br><br>- This looks so good.<br>- It does.<br><br>It's so sweet!<br><br>Hey, I couldn't afford to buy you<br>anything for your old café.<br><br>But if you open a new one,<br>I'll totally buy you something.<br><br>Hey, thanks.

Sir!<br><br>- Sir!<br>- Come out already!<br><br>- Why won't you listen?<br>- What's the matter?<br><br>This stupid dog won't eat.<br><br>Still, you can't do this.<br><br>Then what am I supposed to do?<br>It won't listen to me.<br><br>Sir, the dog can't eat because<br>it's kept on this heavy chain.<br><br>My gosh, it can barely move.<br><br>This way, it can't run away.<br><br>I'll go bring a lightweight leash.<br>I have one in the car.<br><br>I don't need one!<br>I'll just fatten it up and sell it.<br><br>You'll sell it?

	<h1>Indian (2001) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Brave Indian policeman Raj beats up, then arrests Muslim terrorist Khan. This gets him promoted, and he is congratulated by none other than his father-in-law, who is also a very high ranking policeman. Suddenly, Raj finds out that many policemen would like to see Khan go free. He consults his father-in-law and surprisedly finds no support from him. Disagreements and arguments ensue, and his father-in-law gets killed as a result. The Police suspect Raj of killing him, they begin the process of arresting him, and he runs away--while Khan is all set to get freed to do whatever he likes.</p>

<br><br>- I'm not putting this<br>rope around my feet.<br><br>- Take your hands away from your face.<br><br>I wanna see you.<br><br>- Please.<br><br>Please, I have a wife and I have a kid.<br><br>- You have a wife and two kids.<br><br>Awesome.<br><br>Fuck.<br><br>- Hey, mom.<br><br>How did I know it's you?<br><br>Because you're the only one who calls here<br><br>at 8 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>Yeah, mom, I'm fully aware.<br><br>Yeah, the new apartment's great.<br><br>Yeah, my boxes are unpacked.<br><br>They are!<br><br>Okay, some of them are not.<br><br>It's going really well.<br><br>Yeah, I think they're gonna<br>promote me to manager.<br><br>Well, there's a new girl and<br>they want me to train her.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Yeah, I'll tell you all about<br>it tonight, but I gotta go.<br><br>Tell the dog I said hi.<br><br>I love you too.<br><br>Mom, I gotta go.<br><br>I do, I do.<br><br>Bye, bye, bye-bye, bye, bye.<br><br>- Oh, my!<br><br>Look at that flower.<br><br>Don't we look pretty today?<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- There was a new girl looking for you.<br><br>I told her to wait for<br>you in front of room 404.<br><br>It's the first one on your list.<br><br>- I hope you're Amanda.<br><br>This place is gross.<br><br>- It's like a cigarette.<br><br>At first it's completely repulsive,<br><br>then after a while you<br>don't mind it so much.<br><br>And in the end you find yourself addicted.<br><br>Room service.<br><br>You always wanna knock first<br><br>to make sure no one's in the room.<br><br>People always forget to<br>put the tag on the door.<br><br>- Addicted?<br><br>- Yeah, to people watching.<br><br>The people who come here are total freaks.<br><br>Room service!<br><br>So the first thing you wanna<br>do is turn the lights on,<br><br>then check the bathroom<br>to make sure it's empty,<br><br>'cause, you know, sometimes<br>men hide in there.<br><br>- What do you mean?<br><br>- They wait in there for<br>the maids to come in.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>A few years ago, a girl<br>came in to make up a room,<br><br>and the bathroom door was open,<br><br>kind of like it is now,<br><br>and she reached her hand<br>in to turn on the light<br><br>without opening the door to check first,<br><br>and someone was in there.<br><br>And he grabbed her hand and hacked it off.<br><br>So, you better check to<br>make sure it's empty.<br><br>- Are you serious?<br><br>- Yeah, if you wanna survive this place,<br><br>it's the first thing you need to do<br><br>every single time you go into a room.<br><br>- I mean about the lady's hand.<br><br>- Just check the bathroom.<br><br>I'll get the curtains.<br><br>- You asshole!<br><br>That's not even funny.<br><br>- No one ever lost a hand,<br><br>but if some losers have<br>passed out in the bed,<br><br>he's definitely passed<br>out in the bathroom,<br><br>on top of the toilet or in front,<br><br>with his face in it.<br><br>I like to start from the<br>furthest corner of the room<br><br>and clean my way back to the door.<br><br>Can you pull that cart<br>in front of the door?<br><br>It keeps people from wandering in.<br><br>And make sure it's pulled inwards.<br><br>For whatever reason, people<br>really like to steal the soap.<br><br>If the comforter's still on, but wrinkled,<br><br>we don't bother changing<br>the sheets underneath.<br><br>We just straighten out what's on top.<br><br>Knock, knock.<br><br>- Who's there?<br><br>- Fidelio.<br><br>- People don't even<br>use most of this stuff,<br><br>so basically you just<br>need to straighten it up.<br><br>And then, you fold the<br>toilet paper like so,<br><br>and it gives people the<br>impression that it's a new role.<br><br>And then somehow they don't care<br><br>that it's been here<br>for the past six weeks.<br><br>Room service.<br><br>Always take the tag off the door first.<br><br>And now it's off to the next room.<br><br>- That's it?<br><br>- That's it, all day long.<br><br>Over and over and over again.<br><br>- Housekeeping.<br><br>- As gross as the people<br>who come here are,<br><br>they're pretty harmless.<br><br>Just a bunch of creeps,<br>either cheating on their wife<br><br>or paying a hooker to<br>spend some time with them.<br><br>But for the most part they<br>don't wanna be seen here,<br><br>so they pretty much keep to themselves.<br><br>- So nothing ever weird happens?<br><br>- No.<br><br>Aside from the occasional<br>fight over money,<br><br>some guy feeling like he<br>didn't get his full hour.<br><br>A lot of people just<br>try to sneak in and out.<br><br>They're really fun to watch.<br><br>- Well, it was nice meeting you.<br><br>I'll see you tomorrow?<br><br>- Tomorrow's my birthday,<br>where else would I be?<br><br>- Well, I'm gonna say happy birthday now,<br><br>just in case I wake up and forget.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- You're walking home?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well, the bus stop is just up the street.<br><br>- How far do you take it?<br><br>- Just to the other side of Jefferson.<br><br>- Hop in, I'll give you a ride.<br><br>- I don't wanna put you out.<br><br>- Don't be silly, it's<br>on the way, come on.<br><br>- You sure?<br><br>- Yeah, get in.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>You know you can call me<br>on my cellphone, right?<br><br>Minutes are unlimited<br>these days.<br><br>Well, unless you have one of<br>those pay-as-you-go phones,<br><br>and no one uses those, besides terrorists.<br><br>No, the new girl's great.<br><br>She has a car, so I hope she works out.<br><br>I'm kidding.<br><br>No.<br><br>No, I'm not kidding.<br><br>No, she gave me a ride<br>home, it was awesome.<br><br>Yeah, I didn't have to take a bus.<br><br>Sometimes there's pretty<br>creepy guys on there,<br><br>but just when it's late.<br><br>I know you worry.<br><br>Well, because that's what moms do!<br><br>Well, yeah, she's gonna<br>pick me up in the morning.<br><br>I'm on the way.<br><br>Go on, kill him!<br><br>Put down the pistol!<br><br>Do as I say, come on!<br><br>- Is that the mask that you<br>found yesterday at the motel?<br><br>You know, the motel where<br>people pay by the hour.<br><br>So were you born in New York?<br><br>- I was born in New York,<br>but I grew up in Connecticut.<br><br>Probably still be there,<br>if my dad hadn't left.<br><br>My mom just kind of lost it,<br><br>and I tried to stick<br>around as long as I could,<br><br>but she just became too much<br>to handle on a daily basis.<br><br>Shit, this is hot.<br><br>- What about you?<br><br>Are you a real New Yorker?<br><br>- Both born and raised.<br><br>Yeah, my dad checked out too,<br><br>but he checked out long<br>before he went missing.<br><br>- Went missing?<br><br>- Yeah, he was a cop when we were kids.<br><br>He'd always come home<br>and complain to my mom<br><br>about all the murderers<br>and drug dealers out there,<br><br>but they could never get anyone to talk,<br><br>SO no one ever got arrested.<br><br>They just ran wild and it drove him<br><br>and everyone he worked with crazy.<br><br>Got to the point where my<br>dad and his partner were<br><br>setting people up.<br><br>- Like hiring hitmen?<br><br>- No.<br><br>They'd catch someone with drugs,<br><br>take the drugs, take the<br>money and not arrest them.<br><br>Then send them back out in<br>the street empty handed.<br><br>And they'd find those guys two<br>days later in an alley dead.<br><br>- Well, that's one way to handle it.<br><br>- And then one day he<br>just never came home.<br><br>My mom thinks he went<br>crazy, ran off to the woods.<br><br>My brother and I think<br>he got himself killed.<br><br>- How do you usually split up the rooms?<br><br>- I'll take the odd numbers,<br>you can take the even.<br><br>That way, if you need anything,<br><br>I'll be right across the hall.<br><br>- Yeah, we do we got for a room?<br><br>409.<br><br>That one was<br>exceptionally filthy.<br><br>What's next?<br><br>- You have 409 and I have 412.<br><br>Will you shut that damn door?<br><br>- What, you gonna come in and join us,<br><br>or you're just gonna stand there?<br><br>- Leave this kid alone,<br><br>and get back to this bed.<br><br>- Did you just see that?<br><br>- Yeah, it looked like<br>you forgot to knock.<br><br>- Not funny!<br><br>What's wrong with tuna?<br><br>- When I was in fifth grade,<br>the ugliest girl in my class<br><br>inhaled tuna fish sandwiches<br>every day at lunch.<br><br>- Aw, she can't help it<br>if she was born ugly.<br><br>- She wasn't just ugly,<br>she was also an asshole.<br><br>- How could she be an<br>asshole in the fifth grade?<br><br>- When we didn't finish<br>a chapter in class,<br><br>she'd point it out to the teacher<br>and get us extra homework.<br><br>She had yellow teeth with<br>pink braces.<br><br>She was also a hall monitor.<br><br>Anyway, one day the teacher has<br>us sitting down on the floor<br><br>with her shoes off and this<br>kid starts tickling her feet,<br><br>and she starts laughing<br>and her mouth is full<br><br>of fucking tuna, all stuck in her braces,<br><br>three hours after lunch<br>at the end of the day.<br><br>The sight and smell of<br>it was so disgusting,<br><br>it turned me off to tuna<br>for the rest of my life.<br><br>- So how long have you been working here?<br><br>- It'll be a year in September.<br><br>I got three and a half years<br>through a bachelor's degree,<br><br>and then all that shit happened<br>with my dad and I left.<br><br>I think I'll have enough money<br>saved by the end of the year<br><br>to get in on the spring semester.<br><br>And then I don't have to<br>smooth out dirty sheets<br><br>and juggle condoms anymore.<br><br>- What about you?<br><br>- I like to knit.<br><br>- Cool.<br><br>- I don't have any big plans.<br><br>I mostly work here so I don't<br>have to live with my mom.<br><br>- That guy comes in every day.<br><br>I think he just jerks off<br><br>and watches porn all day.<br><br>- You should go and say hi.<br><br>You should go and say hi.<br><br>Maybe he can pay for your college tuition.<br><br>Too soon?<br><br>- You never know, I<br>might be your new boss.<br><br>I almost forgot.<br><br>I baked you a birthday cake.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>I think there's some forks inside.<br><br>- Your cake tastes like<br>something I've had before.<br><br>Really?<br><br>- Do you have any toilet paper?<br><br>- I think so, check my cart.<br><br>- I'm taking two.<br><br>Sure, just don't take it all.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>- Did you write on my list?<br><br>Write in your what?<br><br>- Nothing, I'm talking to myself.<br><br>Housekeeping.<br><br>Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here.<br><br>I knocked, no one answered.<br><br>- It's okay, I'm on my way out.<br><br>- I can come back later if you want.<br><br>- It's okay, I'm on my way out.<br><br>If you scream, I'm going to<br>cut your fucking nose off.<br><br>Do you understand?<br><br>Stand up.<br><br>Stand right here in front of me.<br><br>Go on.<br><br>Take off your clothes.<br><br>I'm only gonna ask you once.<br><br>Everything.<br><br>That's better.<br><br>That's nice.<br><br>Sing me a song.<br><br>- What kind of song?<br><br>- It doesn't matter.<br><br>Just sing.<br><br>Again, again.<br><br>You don't dance when you sing?<br><br>Start over!<br><br>You kiss your daddy with this mouth?<br><br>- My dad's dead, you asshole.<br><br>- That's sweet.<br><br>No!<br><br>- Should I stay or should I go?<br><br>- I think I just need to be<br>alone for a little while.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>But I'm gonna call you in an<br>hour and if you don't pick up,<br><br>I'm coming right back here.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>- Hey, how you doing?<br><br>- I'm okay, I guess.<br><br>I mean, it sucks, but it's<br>something someone else did to me,<br><br>so I'm not gonna let it ruin my life.<br><br>- Do you want me to come over?<br><br>- No, I think I just need to sleep.<br><br>I just can't believe they fired me.<br><br>- They fired you?!<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>When I told Dave that I<br>wasn't coming in tomorrow,<br><br>he just said it would probably be best<br><br>if I didn't come back at all.<br><br>You know, too much, like, bad publicity<br><br>for that kind of business.<br><br>Fuck him.<br><br>- Fuck him.<br><br>- He's fat, bald and obviously miserable.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>But I have some money<br>saved, so it'll be fine.<br><br>I think I'm gonna nod off.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>Well, call me if you need anything, okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>- Seriously.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>I'll talk to you soon.<br><br>Bye.<br>- Bye.<br><br>- Hi, this,<br><br>so awkward.<br><br>I saw your ad and wanted to talk.<br><br>This is about the<br>adoption, my name's Amanda.<br><br>- Hey, you.<br><br>- Hey, I did something weird.<br><br>- Okay, weird how?<br><br>- I called a lady looking to adopt.<br><br>- Okay, kind of weird.<br><br>- Yeah, she didn't answer,<br>so I just left a message.<br><br>- All right, not so weird.<br><br>Just when she calls back, don't pick up.<br><br>Problem solved.<br><br>- Yeah, but I think I wanna do this.<br><br>- I have to make a run to the post office.<br><br>I'll swing by and pick you<br>up and we can go for a ride.<br><br>- Okay, I'll be up front.<br><br>- Okay, talk to me.<br><br>Tell me what's up.<br><br>- I thought I could do this.<br><br>I thought that by having this kid,<br><br>I could make it into one<br>of those something good<br><br>comes from something<br>bad types of situation.<br><br>But the more I think about it,<br><br>the more ridiculous it sounds.<br><br>I was saving for school, 'cause<br>that was important to me,<br><br>and now I can't even pay my rent.<br><br>I mean, I was fucking raped!<br><br>The father of this kid is<br>some piece of who raped me,<br><br>someone who beat me and left me for dead.<br><br>The kind of person who puts five minutes<br><br>of their own pleasure above<br>someone else's right to live.<br><br>I mean look at my face.<br><br>- Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.<br><br>- How can I ever look at<br>a kid that was conceived<br><br>in a moment filled with<br>that much insanity,<br><br>and not be reminded of<br>it every single time?<br><br>I mean, sure, the kid is part me,<br><br>so I'll love the kid, no matter what,<br><br>but it's also part him and I<br>will always hate that part,<br><br>always, no matter what.<br><br>- Okay, do this.<br><br>Let her foster the kid.<br><br>That way, if you ever change your mind,<br><br>you can always get the kid back.<br><br>- That's her.<br><br>- I'll pull over, you can talk in the car.<br><br>- Hello.<br><br>- Hey!<br><br>Tonight's the night.<br><br>Okay, let's go<br>in and climb the fence.<br><br>Once in there, you kick.<br>- Okay.<br><br>So nice to meet you.<br><br>- Hi, nice to meet you too.<br>- Hit<br><br>I love your glasses.<br><br>- Oh, thanks.<br><br>Have a seat.<br><br>Well, I guess since I'm the one asking,<br><br>I'll tell you a little bit about myself.<br><br>It's not a very exciting story really.<br><br>Career woman, I put<br>education and earning money<br><br>ahead of settling down.<br><br>College, medical school, residency,<br><br>and then all of the effort involved<br><br>in setting up a practice,<br><br>I just didn't make time for much else.<br><br>So, here I am.<br><br>I have everything I<br>want, except for a baby.<br><br>I mean, I figured I've done<br>everything else on my own.<br><br>Why not this, right?<br><br>Oh yeah, you're right.<br><br>- You don't have to tell me anything<br><br>about yourself just yet.<br><br>I just wanted to meet you.<br><br>And you're every bit as<br>lovely as I expected.<br><br>- It's okay, it just sort<br>of happened unexpectedly.<br><br>And then I lost my job.<br><br>And this wasn't something I planned for,<br><br>so I think it'll be better<br>for everyone this way.<br><br>- You know, life can be tough.<br><br>Is everything else okay?<br><br>You know, everything else.<br><br>- I'm not sure what you mean.<br><br>- Well, you're young.<br><br>When I was your age, I liked to experiment<br><br>with different things.<br><br>Smoked a little pot, did<br>some acid in college.<br><br>Hell, maybe I did a<br>little bit more than that,<br><br>but either I'm not telling or<br>I don't remember.<br><br>Oh, let's just say I don't remember.<br><br>- That sounds like you did a lot,<br><br>if you can't remember.<br><br>I don't drink, smoke or use drugs,<br><br>so the doctor said that<br>the baby's healthy.<br><br>I didn't wanna know.<br><br>So I can't tell you if it's<br>gonna be a boy or a girl.<br><br>I could give you my doctor's number<br><br>and you can find out, if<br>you really need to know.<br><br>Maybe, but surprises can<br>be fun, right?<br><br>I have some information<br><br>that I thought you might like to see.<br><br>Just a little bit about me, my practice,<br><br>just so you know.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- Can I get this?<br><br>I'm sorry, it might be work related.<br><br>I could take it outside if you want.<br><br>- Oh, oh, no, it's okay.<br><br>I have to use the bathroom anyway.<br><br>- Dr. Gilden speaking.<br><br>- So, was she weird?<br><br>No, she was nice.<br><br>I think it's gonna be okay.<br><br>I remember when my dad used to take us<br><br>down here when we were kids.<br><br>He'd always say it was nice to sit with us<br><br>and not have to think about<br>those animals in the city.<br><br>It was a lot nicer back then.<br><br>And then he would tell<br>us that it was illegal<br><br>to swim in Central Park.<br><br>Followed by the same terrible joke.<br><br>He'd say, "How many tickles does it take<br><br>to make an octopus laugh?"<br><br>- I don't know.<br><br>- Ten-tickles.<br><br>He was so corny,<br><br>but me and my brother always laughed.<br><br>- Here.<br><br>- What's this?<br><br>- Open it.<br><br>I was gonna give it to you after.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- You're welcome.<br><br>Wait, one more.<br><br>Oh my God!<br><br>Did you make these?<br><br>Oh my God!<br><br>You are an old lady!<br><br>- Shut up!<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>Really, really, thank you for this.<br><br>- You're welcome.<br><br>Call me later, okay?<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>Wait, wait!<br><br>I almost forgot this stuff.<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>- Hi.<br><br>I didn't mean to startle you.<br><br>I just had to leave so abruptly earlier,<br><br>I didn't want you to<br>think I was being rude.<br><br>- Oh no, I just assumed that you get<br><br>pretty busy during the day.<br><br>- I've read about this.<br><br>You know, I always wanted<br>to write a children's book.<br><br>If I didn't go to med school,<br><br>I could have been a children's author.<br><br>- How did you know where I live?<br><br>- Oh, I just looked your address up.<br><br>Hope you don't think<br>I'm being too forward.<br><br>You know, it turns out that my secretary<br><br>used to work for your obstetrician.<br><br>- You can come inside if you'd like.<br><br>Yeah, it was weird.<br><br>She was just standing outside<br>when I got to my front door.<br><br>I don't know if she's just being polite<br><br>about skipping out on lunch<br>and it freaked me out,<br><br>'cause no one's polite anymore.<br><br>- Or maybe she wants to<br>Kill you and take your baby.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>- Is that it?<br><br>- Can you actually grab<br>me a jar of pickles?<br><br>- I knew this girl.<br><br>She craved vinegar when she was pregnant.<br><br>At first it was vinegar on her salad,<br><br>then it was vinegar-flavored,<br>potato chips,<br><br>then it was salt and vinegar popcorn.<br><br>Eventually she just started drinking it<br><br>straight out of the bottle.<br><br>Her baby was born<br>premature, had a clubfoot.<br><br>So sad.<br><br>It was probably dehydration.<br><br>Vinegar can dehydrate you.<br><br>- I'll be careful.<br><br>- I know who you are.<br><br>It isn't necessary.<br><br>Dr. Gilden said to bill it to her account.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Fine, call me back when<br>you get your shit together,<br><br>whoever this is.<br><br>I only wanted you to make him talk<br><br>before you killed him.<br><br>That's what we were trying to do,<br><br>so I got to find out who killed my father.<br><br>And I still don't know!<br><br>You ain't too smart, Marshall.<br><br>- Don't you know what a good shot I am?<br><br>That was you who told the judge<br><br>you definitely saw me kill man.<br><br>- Hello?<br><br>- Hi, it's Catherine.<br><br>I got my shit together.<br><br>Oh my God.<br><br>You probably think I'm such<br>a bitch, I swear I'm not.<br><br>- Oh, don't be silly.<br><br>I was going through a<br>tunnel, we lost reception.<br><br>Anyway, I didn't get a<br>chance to speak to you<br><br>before you left the grocery store.<br><br>- Oh, sorry, I didn't know that was you.<br><br>I was expecting a package<br>and I wanted to make sure<br><br>I was here when the mailman came,<br><br>so I pretty much rushed back.<br><br>- Well, I just wanted to let you know<br><br>that I have an account<br>at the grocery store,<br><br>so if you need anything, just get it,<br><br>and tell them to bill me, okay?<br><br>- Oh, that's sweet.<br><br>Sorry, that's the doorbell, I gotta run.<br><br>- You better run.<br><br>Could be the delivery man.<br><br>Let's talk later.<br><br>- Definitely, talk soon.<br><br>Order 261,<br>I have one curly fry,<br><br>three plain, two small Cokes.<br>- Yes, that's me.<br><br>- There you go, have a great day.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Here you go.<br><br>- I feel so fat, I hate it.<br><br>- Well, you are eating like a wild boar.<br><br>- Do boars even eat that much?<br><br>- They're pigs.<br><br>Or maybe you're having twins.<br><br>- Okay, that's not even funny.<br><br>- It's pretty funny.<br><br>There's this one lady that had twins,<br><br>something like 87 days apart.<br><br>- Is that even possible?<br><br>- Apparently.<br><br>She gave birth to one kid,<br><br>and then three months<br>later had another one.<br><br>Twins.<br><br>87 days apart.<br><br>- Fuck.<br><br>- I swear.<br><br>I think it happened in London.<br><br>Or was it Ireland?<br><br>- So, something weird happened yesterday.<br><br>I'm at the grocery store and<br>the lady at the cash register,<br><br>she wouldn't take my money.<br><br>- Go on.<br><br>- She tells me that Dr. Gilden told her<br><br>to put my groceries on her tab.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>- They know me there.<br><br>That's weird.<br><br>- Who's Dr. Gilden?<br><br>- Really? The woman who<br>wants to adopt this baby.<br><br>Are you even listening?<br><br>- You're right, that's weird.<br><br>- Yeah, that's really fucking weird.<br><br>- Maybe she just wants to make<br>sure you're eating healthy.<br><br>She's a doctor after all.<br><br>- That's strike two.<br><br>- Strike two? Was there a strike one?<br><br>- Yeah, first that bitch<br>looked up my address<br><br>and just showed up at my door<br>after skipping out on lunch.<br><br>- Okay, strike one for sure.<br><br>- Now she's following<br>me to the grocery store<br><br>and spying on me while I shop?<br><br>Then insulting me by insinuating<br><br>that I can't pay for my own groceries,<br><br>asking me if everything's okay,<br><br>as if I look like some fucking crack head.<br><br>Fuck that!<br><br>- Okay, strike two, but<br>take the free groceries.<br><br>You know, if she keeps<br>acting like a weirdo,<br><br>this isn't gonna work out.<br><br>I would rather live with<br>a baby in a dumpster<br><br>than give her to some psycho stalker.<br><br>- Her?<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>- You just referred to the baby as her.<br><br>- I did?<br><br>- Yeah, you did.<br><br>- I asked the doctor the<br>other day after lunch.<br><br>I don't know, I guess<br>the stress of everything,<br><br>it was really getting to me.<br><br>And I had to know something.<br><br>It's a girl.<br><br>- Is this strike three?<br><br>- That bitch!<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>- I was just checking in to<br>make sure everything was okay.<br><br>- Well, it's not your<br>job to check in on me.<br><br>Is that my mail?<br><br>- Oh, yeah, the mail man gave it to me.<br><br>He thought I was your mother.<br><br>- Can I have my mail, please?<br><br>- Imagine that, your mother.<br><br>I mean, your sister, I could-<br><br>- Please leave, this<br>was a really bad idea.<br><br>What don't you understand about<br>get the fuck away from me?<br><br>- I really think you should go,<br><br>she seems really upset.<br><br>- Let go of my fucking arm!<br><br>- Where are you going?<br><br>- That stupid bitch opened my mail.<br><br>- Let it go, that woman is crazy,<br><br>and like you're gonna fight anyone anyway.<br><br>You're a million months pregnant<br><br>and your stomach is about to explode.<br><br>- How fucking weird is that?<br><br>- Okay, that was weird, I<br>totally get what you mean now.<br><br>- Who opens other people's mail?<br><br>I mean, who the fuck does that?<br><br>She doesn't even know me!<br><br>Do I call her and tell her to fuck off?<br><br>- I think you already sent that message.<br><br>- Well, do I call the police?<br><br>- Let's not agitate her,<br>this woman is clearly rabbed,<br><br>we don't know what'll send her off.<br><br>- Hi, I'm trying to reach Doctor Gilden.<br><br>The two of you need to take at least a day<br><br>before you even consider<br>talking to each other.<br><br>- I'm sorry, what?<br><br>- My dad has a place in<br>hours on north of here,<br><br>where we can go for a couple of days-<br><br>- She's not even a doctor.<br><br>- What?<br>- I just called her office<br><br>and she's not even a fucking doctor.<br><br>- It's Friday, I can take<br>Monday off from work.<br><br>- I'm gonna throw up, oh my God.<br><br>- And we can stop and get<br>some snacks along the way.<br><br>- What about this?<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>- What about this?<br><br>- Just get whatever.<br><br>Get two of everything if you want.<br><br>- Sorry.<br><br>- It's 98,50.<br><br>- Charge everything to Catherine<br>Gilden's account, please.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>- Here we are.<br><br>In the finest outdated cottage<br><br>half a divorce settlement can buy.<br><br>- Are you sure your dad's not gonna mind?<br><br>- It's fine.<br><br>He hasn't been here since Christmas,<br><br>three years ago.<br><br>Hopefully he remembered<br>to turn off the water.<br><br>If he didn't and the pipes<br>froze or broke or whatever,<br><br>we're gonna have to<br>find a lake to bathe in.<br><br>- Yeah, that's all someone needs,<br><br>to stumble upon a naked pregnant<br>woman bathing in a lake.<br><br>- Go inside, I'm gonna get<br>the stuff from the car.<br><br>- Are you sure?

Correct me if l' m wrong.<br><br>Did you not tell me that<br>we should always be beautiful?<br><br>What if you find some guy<br>here in Santorini...<br><br>then you fall in love with him?<br><br>Do you want him to see you<br>looking like an old maid?<br><br>You know it's not my plan here in Greece<br>to look for a long distance relationship.<br><br>You know what I need to do?<br><br>I need to think! I need to study<br>and I need to rest!<br><br>Chit, bro.<br><br>Like what I've told you last week,<br>I cannot join you.<br><br>I mean, if Regatta is far from<br>the Philippines, I won't hesitate to join.<br><br>But if my mom finds out that<br>l' m just near the Philippines...<br><br>she won't let me come back here.<br><br>You know what,<br>you should try living here in Greece.<br><br>Life here is simple,<br>with delicious food and pretty ladies.<br><br>I' m tired. I' ll just stay here.<br><br>- How about you? Are you not tired yet?<br>- I don't want to waste my time sleeping!<br><br>Nanny, are you not forgetting something?<br><br>Yes. Good thing you told me.<br><br>It's hot outside.<br>Okay, l' ll leave now. Bye.<br><br>Nanny, you're still forgetting something.<br><br>What else?

Okay?<br><br>What's this?<br><br>You have a lot of nerves, huh?<br><br>Why did you just do that?<br><br>Because I've already mastered<br>your playboy style!<br><br>Style? What style?<br><br>That! You' ll approach the girl you like...<br><br>you' ll stand on her left,<br>then you' ll talk to her for a bit...<br><br>flirt with her a bit and then what?<br>What's next?<br><br>You' ll hold her hand...<br><br>and in just a short while<br>you already have her fooled...<br><br>she's already your girlfriend<br>without courting her.<br><br>- Wow! How did you know that?<br>- There.<br><br>I don't remember dating you.<br><br>Date me? Huh, you wish!<br><br>Okay, so how did you become<br>an expert on my style?<br><br>How do I know?<br><br>- You want?<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Because you've been<br>everybody's boyfriend...<br><br>- Seth.<br>- Everybody but you!<br><br>- So that's why you're so mad, huh?<br>- Excuse me!<br><br>Tell me, what do you really get out of<br>breaking the hearts of all those girls, huh?<br><br>What are you saying?<br>I hate break ups.<br><br>It's not a good feeling when you<br>know you've broken a girl's feelings.<br><br>Then don't hurt them!<br>Seth, it's that simple.<br><br>You know you don't even stay long enough<br>in a relationship to make it work.<br><br>- Aha!

They can have a life.<br><br>It's pointless that you volunteered<br>to manage the taverna...<br><br>if you don't really have plans<br>of making it profitable.<br><br>It's your responsibility to your<br>employees and their families...<br><br>to make the restaurant generate income.<br><br>You know what...<br><br>that's just like the article I read<br>about you last night on the internet.<br><br>Yeah!

If that's what you want.<br><br>Sophia Carmina Sandoval.<br>So where are we going?<br><br>So you came here in Greece<br>just to accompany nanny Josie?<br><br>No, it's a birthday gift from my brother.<br><br>It's your birthday?<br><br>Last March.<br><br>It's June already.<br>Why just now?<br><br>Nothing. Too busy working.<br><br>Actually, I have more work now...<br><br>but my flight ticket is about to expire<br>so I have no choice but to go.<br><br>What?

Another Diego Ocampo?<br><br>Have you not been burned?<br><br>Have you never learned?<br><br>Now that our real estate<br>business relies on you.<br><br>Sophia, don't you have any<br>respect left for yourself?<br><br>Dad!<br><br>Take it easy.<br>I think she gets the point.<br><br>I don't think she gets the point<br>at all, Gregory!<br><br>If she understands what she is doing...<br><br>she will not have any relation<br>with this guy!<br><br>Did she not just tell you?<br><br>Seth courted her<br>but she jilted him, that's it!<br><br>Why do you have to believe everything<br>that the news says...<br><br>about her than your own daughter.<br><br>Are you telling me<br>that all of this was made up?<br><br>All our employees saw it...<br><br>which she did not deny!<br><br>She said it's over, right?<br><br>She said the same thing 6 years ago!<br><br>We both thought it was over.<br><br>But what happened at the hospital?<br><br>We found out that she's still into Diego.<br><br>Dad.

We have to dance.<br><br>Maybe you'd rather dance a<br>round with your honey horses.<br><br>What were their names again?<br><br>Werner and Bianca?<br><br>Theo and Luise.<br><br>Oops.<br><br>I shouldn't have talked about it.<br><br>Unfortunately, you can't.<br>They're already sleeping.<br><br>Hopefully.<br><br>What are your friends saying<br>about you being so obsessed?<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, them?<br><br>What friends?<br><br>They can still come.<br><br>We are the champions!<br><br>But we had that.<br><br>The Bund...<br><br>The Trade Union of North<br>German Merchants is called...<br><br>A little tip, start with H.<br><br>Show us the monster tip.<br><br>Friederike.<br><br>You can't concentrate,<br>you're talking all the time.<br><br>What?<br><br>I didn't even think about it.<br><br>Our little ice cream.<br><br>Yes, it's good.<br><br>Quiet!<br><br>But I can already tell who's provoking who.<br><br>Not him, red cap.<br><br>Every time.<br><br>We're home.<br><br>The ice cream is running.<br><br>Two minus.<br><br>Two minus? With the swab back?<br><br>That's a flat five.<br><br>But Nils, it could be that you<br>have no idea about women.<br><br>Or it could be that you're disabled.<br><br>Buried or shaved.<br><br>Doesn't matter, but not the expensive ones.<br><br>And now the photo is<br>leaking out, you shooter.<br><br>No.<br><br>So with this phone number,<br>there's nothing to say.<br><br>When I was your age, I got three<br>numbers from women per night.<br><br>Yes, as a medium.<br><br>That was before the accident.<br><br>But if you're so sure, call her.<br><br>Why call?<br><br>Oh, you don't understand, boy.<br><br>Women test men, women<br>give their numbers and test.<br><br>What do they test?<br><br>If you've got guts, if you're<br>a bottle or if you're brave.<br><br>If you let the three days<br>wait, you're screwed.<br><br>That's not my philosophy, Uwe.<br><br>You have to take it step by step.<br><br>With style.<br><br>You know what I think?<br><br>You didn't get a phone number.<br><br>You would have liked to, but you don't.<br><br>Yes. Not bad.<br><br>One minus, I'd say.<br><br>One minus? One plus!<br><br>Plus is not possible.<br><br>Hey, look!<br><br>No! It's about the time<br>for the open training.<br><br>But five days before the German<br>championship, there has to be a schedule.<br><br>Mr. Wiemeyer?<br><br>You're not being paid for making calls.<br><br>I know, sorry.<br><br>But try to get into the other ranks.<br><br>They say that Frederique<br>gets her arrogant tits in a row,<br><br>is absent because of some<br>tournament, and doesn't talk to anyone,<br><br>because she thinks she's better.<br><br>You're just jealous, you don't<br>have to take it so seriously.<br><br>I take it seriously.<br><br>Can't you try to take a<br>small step to the other ranks?<br><br>There are so many<br>nice people in your class.<br><br>Andi, for example, or Sonja.<br><br>Just dare, they don't bite.<br><br>I have to go now, unfortunately.<br><br>I still have to go to the training.<br><br>Frederique!<br><br>You isolate yourself with your way,<br>and in the end you end up alone.<br><br>They don't understand anything at all.<br><br>What did she say to you?<br><br>Doesn't matter now.<br><br>He's frozen.<br><br>Just believe it.<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>He was never frozen.<br><br>Happy New Year.<br><br>Come on, you lazy toad.<br><br>Always easy, Rike.<br><br>That's what happens when you get drunk.<br><br>I wasn't drunk.<br><br>Of course you were.<br><br>Otherwise you wouldn't have been so weird.<br><br>You know exactly what I mean.<br><br>It was pretty embarrassing how you acted.<br><br>It wasn't.<br><br>I was just talking.<br><br>That's all.<br><br>You didn't crash into her, did you?<br><br>Nils! Stop!<br><br>He's frozen.<br><br>You have no idea.<br><br>I am the ghost of the Waldsee!<br><br>I smell human flesh!<br><br>Hey.<br><br>You're dreaming all the time.<br><br>You're standing right next to her.<br><br>What are you imagining?<br><br>Yes, all the time.<br><br>What's wrong with dad today?<br><br>Dad fell in love.<br><br>What was that, Mara?<br><br>He didn't say anything.<br><br>It was Bernhard and Bianca.<br><br>No, Theo and Luise.<br><br>I was confused.<br><br>Do you have a problem?<br><br>No.<br><br>I didn't fall in love.<br><br>You're so childish for your age.<br><br>You're in love.<br><br>Look at me.<br><br>What?<br><br>Come on. If you're not in<br>love, you can look at me.<br><br>It's none of your business, you hear?<br><br>Well, I just mean it.<br><br>Because the number is too big for you.<br><br>I'll just keep it that way.<br><br>But at some point it's enough.<br><br>And then I'm gone.<br><br>Are you still there?<br><br>I was lucky.<br><br>You can play alone.<br><br>Oh, now daddy is angry.<br><br>But mum was right.<br><br>It's all too individual, too much to fight.<br><br>You have to be more self-confident.<br><br>I've told you a hundred times.<br><br>Tension...<br><br>In the middle of the<br>body during the lift. I know.<br><br>We have to pay more<br>attention to that next time, okay?<br><br>No.<br><br>Rieke, not we. Not we, you.<br><br>It's about your mistake, the<br>doctor can't do anything about it.<br><br>Dad, let's try it out tomorrow<br>at the training on site.<br><br>If we talk about it now...<br><br>It's just about a few<br>technical details anyway.<br><br>Rieke, you don't hear it,<br>it's not about technique.<br><br>It's about your overall expression.<br><br>Shall we see how something<br>like that works with Lydia Pascal?<br><br>No, we don't want to.<br><br>Sorry, but I still have homework to do.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>Can't we just do it tomorrow?<br><br>That's what I mean.<br><br>This is Pep, this is<br>Esprit, this is sexy, this<br><br>is international, this<br>is the opposite of you.<br><br>Nils, are you already sleeping?<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Hello.<br><br>I have to think about you all the time.<br><br>You've somehow totally<br>messed me up, because...<br><br>I thought you were<br>really cute the other day.<br><br>I think I'm a little crazy about you.<br><br>Is it bad?<br><br>No.<br><br>No, it's cheesy. Shit.<br><br>Hi, doll.<br><br>Guess who's here. Surprise.<br><br>You know, I have to go to Munich<br>the next few days anyway, and...<br><br>No.<br><br>I wanted to ask, because<br>you said we both...<br><br>So, if you have time, a little<br>meeting, at a cafe or at the cinema.<br><br>Ludia?<br><br>Vegetable?<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>Something's not right today.<br>You're totally unconcentrated.<br><br>Federica?<br><br>Why?<br><br>It's Friday as always.<br><br>No, it's not as always.<br><br>You pushed me off the plane.<br><br>Rieke, do you need a special invitation?<br><br>I have the feeling you're<br>really looking for a lot today.<br><br>How would it be if you<br>would sleep at night?<br><br>Let's not talk big,<br>let's just do it normally.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Let's look at it first, otherwise<br>it won't make any sense.<br><br>So, you didn't get the pressure<br>point again, because the blind...<br><br>That doesn't help to look at the mistakes.<br><br>Let's just try it normally.<br>Nils, come on, please!<br><br>If you're going to be like this, we<br>don't need to go to the championship.<br><br>The judges will laugh at us.<br><br>But I did it exactly as<br>you explained it to me.<br><br>Unfortunately you didn't.<br><br>Otherwise it would have<br>looked better. There, look here.<br><br>Then you have to explain it to me better.<br><br>It's obvious that we're going<br>to Garmisch in three days.<br><br>Rieke, listen to me<br>when I'm talking to you.<br><br>I've been working my ass off for<br>years and you're playing the little diva.<br><br>Do you think it's okay?<br><br>No.<br><br>What have you achieved so far?<br><br>If it matters.<br><br>It's not that much, Rieke.<br><br>Dad.<br><br>Rieke.<br><br>Hello, listen to me.<br><br>Who's fooling around?<br><br>Are you serious?<br><br>Dad, stop it, please.<br><br>Get out of here, I'm<br>staying with your sister.<br><br>No, but that's totally unfair.<br><br>Oh, do you want to play the hero again?<br><br>No, but you can't do that.<br><br>We're still a family after all.<br><br>Well, if that's the case...<br><br>then do it.<br><br>I think you have to tighten the screw here.<br><br>Something is wobbling.<br><br>Yes, I'll do that later.<br><br>I don't know what's going on today.<br><br>Yes, Rieke. You know that.<br><br>You're under pressure.<br><br>And that's always been a problem for you.<br><br>You have to get through<br>it, no one else can help you.<br><br>Yes, I know.<br><br>But do you know what Nils said today?<br><br>Rieke, it doesn't help<br>that you keep pushing Nils.<br><br>It's your own fear.<br><br>He has to look us in the eye.<br><br>No one can help you. Not me and...<br><br>Nils almost can't.<br><br>If I overdo it, you have to tell me.<br>Then we have to draw the consequences.<br><br>What consequences?<br><br>I don't want to play the bad guy.<br><br>Then we combine Nils with another runner.<br><br>And with whom?<br><br>Only with Lydia.<br><br>She's looking for a new partner.<br><br>Because Hagen injured his knee.<br><br>There is a concrete offer on the<br>table and it's really about a lot of money.<br><br>I think it's a comedy, Rieke.<br><br>It's not a comedy.<br><br>Be quiet.<br><br>Isn't that funny?<br><br>It's because you don't have a sense for it.<br><br>No sense for what?<br><br>For romance.<br><br>If you know what it is.<br><br>No. Explain.<br><br>Well, if two people flirt, for example.<br><br>Attention, expert.<br><br>First you look deep into each other's eyes.<br><br>Then you pretend to find the<br>other person terribly boring.<br><br>And then you kiss.<br><br>Hurry up, please.<br><br>I'm not stupid, but<br>I'd invite her to dinner,<br><br>and fill her up with red<br>wine so she can't drive.<br><br>That's important. And then to the pleasure.<br><br>And always ready to take out the gum.<br><br>It wasn't so important before,<br>but the women of today...<br><br>Can you shut up for five minutes?<br><br>My God, you're so<br>confused. It'll never work.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Do you take out the gum?<br><br>Wine gum?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>No, eh, condoms.<br><br>Condoms.<br><br>The condom isn't for me, but the<br>young man back there doesn't dare to ask.<br><br>So...<br><br>Don't listen to him.<br>He's mentally retarded.<br><br>What am I?<br><br>Ah! Help!<br><br>Ah! My ear!<br><br>Well, chilling again?<br><br>Pretty shitty when you're<br>sitting here all alone, huh?<br><br>What are you doing this afternoon?<br><br>Why?<br><br>Well, I'm going to the<br>cafe to play some football.<br><br>I can't. I have training.<br><br>Well, you can't always train.<br><br>No, you can't.<br><br>And after that?<br><br>I've already made an<br>appointment with someone.<br><br>And...<br><br>when else?<br><br>No, I don't think so, to be honest.<br><br>What can I say, Rieke?<br><br>Good, nice, very gentle.<br><br>So, it's possible.<br><br>And don't give up now.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>You're slurping.<br><br>And Nils, look at her now!<br><br>Do you have to go again?<br><br>Yes, Uwe had a problem with his e-roller.<br><br>Probably the batteries are all dead again.<br><br>And when will you come back?<br><br>Why?<br><br>It can't take that long.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>You smell good.<br><br>I have to go.<br><br>He's standing outside and can't leave.<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Have fun?<br><br>It's work, not fun.<br><br>You know what I hate about small towns?<br><br>That people stare at you like in a zoo.<br><br>It's because of your advertising.<br><br>I don't understand you<br>when you talk so quietly.<br><br>It's because of your advertising<br>that's hanging around here.<br><br>I think it's pretty good.<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>It must be a terrible feeling when you're<br>hanging around like this in the city.<br><br>You get used to it.<br><br>I'm sorry, I have to go.<br><br>Really? Can you still drive?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>I'm just going to<br>Munich, it's a nice place.<br><br>Yeah, probably.<br><br>Tell me, what do you think of my offer?<br><br>Well, it's interesting. I just<br>have to be with my family.<br><br>You know, my sister.<br><br>Do you want to have a drink with me?<br><br>Do you want to have a drink with me?<br><br>Hey, I'll invite you, no problem.<br><br>== You're going to go to bed,<br>aren't you? == I am. I'm exhausted.<br><br>== You have to go to bed, though.<br>== I really have to go back today.<br><br>Tell me, what are you planning to do?<br><br>== Are you drunk<br>again? == Just a little bit.<br><br>I think that's pretty unprofessional,<br>right before the championship.<br><br>But I'm not interested.<br><br>I wanted to tell you something.<br>Something important.<br><br>What kind of secret<br>negotiations are you having?<br><br>Are you going crazy?<br><br>You're having secret<br>negotiations behind my back.<br><br>I know exactly what's going on.<br><br>Dad told me everything.<br><br>These Lydia's are looking<br>for new runners and...<br><br>You're being hysterical.<br><br>This Hergen has injured himself<br>and you're supposed to replace him.<br><br>You're a traitor.<br><br>That's not what it's about.<br><br>Don't you get it?<br><br>You're sniffing my private life.<br><br>It's two days before the<br>German Championships.<br><br>You're negotiating with<br>this pussy, you stupid ass.<br><br>I don't care when I'll meet her.<br><br>You don't give a shit.<br><br>You don't stand a chance with her.<br><br>She's just wiggling around and you<br>think she wants something from you.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>You don't stand a chance with her.<br><br>Because you're such a little pimple.<br><br>I'm still going to feel really bad for her.<br><br>Can you give me the butter, please?<br><br>Please, please, please, the butter.<br><br>Please, please, please, the butter.<br><br>Tell me, is there<br>something eaten out of you?<br><br>Me?<br><br>This woman, your teacher,<br>oh God, what's her name?<br><br>Mrs. Neumann.<br><br>Oh, red cap.<br><br>What?<br><br>That's her nickname.<br><br>Yeah, whatever, she wants me<br>to come to my parents' tonight.<br><br>But I don't like that at all.<br><br>We'll see each other later.<br><br>Don't be too late, this is a<br>final rule, just as a reminder.<br><br>Did you hear that, little boy?<br><br>Rieke! Are you crazy?<br><br>Did you hurt yourself?<br><br>He's crazy, he just let me go!<br><br>I didn't do anything. She's<br>just limping, as always.<br><br>It hurts.<br><br>Now you two, pull yourselves together!<br><br>It's not going to be like the horse<br>anyway. We can stay at home.<br><br>Stop talking nonsense! You stay in<br>your circle and Rieke, tighten your hips!<br><br>Is it really that bad?<br><br>I don't know if you really appreciate<br>your daughter. I see that she's suffering.<br><br>And that's partly because<br>she barely has time to<br><br>think about anything<br>else than running on ice.<br><br>But now you're getting mixed up<br>in the questions of the relationship.<br><br>No, I mean, it's impossible to separate.<br><br>I'm just starting to understand.<br><br>What?<br><br>With the red cap, the hair, nothing!<br><br>Nothing!<br><br>Mr. Wehmeyer, you're overreaching<br>your daughter. You're isolating her.<br><br>I mean, it's certainly not easy<br>for you as an only child father.<br><br>Now, listen to me, Mrs. Lahn.<br><br>Have you ever heard of goals? Of visions?<br><br>That there's something in life that's<br>more important than anything else?<br><br>That's high-performance sports.<br><br>It can be heaven or<br>hell. It's victory or defeat.<br><br>And in any case, it's better<br>than being poisoned all<br><br>day and hanging out in<br>front of some video games.<br><br>And as long as you<br>haven't understood that,<br><br>please spare me your<br>pedagogical nonsense.<br><br>I'm sorry about earlier.<br><br>But you know, maybe it's better if<br>we don't run together any longer.<br><br>The championship is still<br>on and then game over.<br><br>You used to pee in my bathtub.<br><br>Can you pee somewhere else?<br><br>Not that long ago. Take care.<br><br>I'd put on something.<br><br>It's very cold, you know.<br><br>You're quite a bright boy, you know.<br><br>Has anyone ever told you how<br>silly it looks with your mini-tits?<br><br>Is someone getting threatened?<br><br>Leave it.<br><br>Are you afraid?<br><br>Oh my God, the little<br>baby is really afraid.<br><br>You don't need to be afraid.<br><br>No.<br><br>Come on, little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Oh, yes, kiss me.<br><br>Shut the door.<br><br>Kiss me.<br><br>Not so gently.<br><br>Don't be afraid.<br><br>You're kissing like a pig.<br><br>You're crazy.<br><br>But Rico has to eat something too.<br><br>Otherwise you'll collapse us tomorrow.<br><br>Come on, one for daddy.<br><br>What's up with her today?<br><br>Is she having a bad day or what?<br><br>Who should know?<br><br>I have a pair like that,<br>Friederike and Nils Wehmeyer.<br><br>You have the big chance.<br><br>Basically, the first place is clear.<br><br>You can take the lead.<br><br>In this new situation,<br><br>is the pressure a little different?<br><br>Has the pressure changed?<br><br>The pressure is always there.<br><br>But the preliminary race went optimally.<br><br>We systematically prepared for tomorrow.<br><br>Oh, I've sorted out the<br>thing with the ice rink.<br><br>Just send Nils over, we'll check him out.<br><br>I can go for a walk with Lydia.<br><br>Peter, I still don't feel<br>like talking to you about it.<br><br>Well, but Werner Wehmeyer can be home soon.<br><br>My God, are you sensitive today?<br><br>Of course I'm sensitive when<br>you're hanging on to me like a man.<br><br>Could it be that you're<br>running away from something?<br><br>Yes, from you.<br><br>Peter, I have two children.<br><br>You can't just tear them apart like that.<br><br>It has to do with family.<br><br>Yes, yes, family.<br><br>Back then you didn't even know<br>how to wrap your own children.<br><br>But you...<br><br>No, but I'm not talking nonsense.<br><br>Look, if someone raised<br>his children professionally,<br><br>then you.<br><br>There was no aura.<br><br>You learn to jump by falling.<br><br>You said you were tough and consistent.<br><br>That's what sports require.<br><br>Yes, but I don't expect<br>anything else from you.<br><br>If Lydia does it tomorrow, with Nils,<br><br>I'll be the first to congratulate you.<br><br>But if not, then you'll<br>have to make a decision.<br><br>A professional decision.<br><br>Tough and consistent.<br><br>Please turn off the TV and go to bed.<br><br>That's no use.<br><br>Liga, it's half past two.<br><br>Please go to bed.<br><br>You like to eat, don't you?<br><br>Finally you're here! How do you look?<br><br>Now tell me!<br><br>Get lost!<br><br>You want to fumble again?<br><br>Leave me alone!<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>Who started it?<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>We won't make it.<br><br>Don't cry, Rick.<br><br>I'm here.<br><br>Everything's as usual.<br><br>It's not as usual.<br><br>It's all over.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Now it's all about here and now.<br><br>You have the audience<br>on your side. I noticed<br><br>that when I walked<br>in. They're behind you.<br><br>Did you catch a cold?<br><br>Not so dramatic.<br><br>That's because you're half-naked.<br><br>Forget it. It's no use saying anything.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Let's go. Full speed ahead.<br><br>Look at me, Rieke.<br><br>So, let's go. Come on.<br><br>It's not decided yet.<br><br>It's just a test.<br><br>Think about how it went.<br><br>You can do it.<br><br>You will make it. And always<br>think about the rubbers.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Are you crazy?<br><br>You could have...<br><br>I have time today, by the way.<br><br>Because you said you could<br>have coffee or something.<br><br>Psst! We don't want to disturb<br>you. We just want to listen.<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>Well? Did Friederike get mad at you?<br><br>Aww, did she say something funny to you?<br><br>Come on, you have to say something!<br><br>No. No, no. She just asked if I<br>wanted to go to the café with her.<br><br>You disappoint us too much.<br><br>I told her to piss off.<br><br>Pooping is correct.<br><br>But not with frigidairike.<br><br>I'm not going to drink coffee with a fart.<br><br>It's too tight anyway.<br><br>Moschitechnically.<br><br>Except for the virgin.<br><br>That's just smell.<br><br>Not nice frigidairike.<br><br>Leave me alone, you proll.<br><br>What?<br><br>What was that?<br><br>Prolete.<br><br>Oliver, stop it! Oliver, stop it!<br><br>I wanted to do it again.<br><br>I was just finishing.<br><br>Tell me, are you completely crazy now?<br><br>I'm talking to you.<br><br>Someone has to tell you what to<br>do, so that this doesn't happen again.<br><br>I mean...<br><br>I've held you back once, sorry.<br><br>I understand.<br><br>You know we both understand each other.<br><br>I'll show you.<br><br>You won't learn anything, you little brat.<br><br>Now, piss off.<br><br>You can't let them<br>provoke you, they're idiots.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, I know.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>It was nice of them.<br><br>These are excellent fitness values.<br><br>Here, touch times, jump heights.<br><br>You're a real masterpiece.<br><br>Well, I think Mr. Tropsch is out.<br><br>We can start training tomorrow.<br><br>Yeah, I don't want to waste any time.<br><br>We'll take care of your apartment.<br><br>Don't worry about that.<br><br>And I'll have a contract signed.<br><br>Nils.<br><br>It's about gold at the wedding.<br><br>We're putting our hopes in you.<br><br>You'll get to know<br>each other a bit, I'd say.<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>I'm just thinking.<br><br>We're offering you heaven<br>on earth and you're thinking.<br><br>Crazy.<br><br>It's because of your sister, isn't it?<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>But you can think about it.<br><br>You know what?<br><br>You just have to decide.<br><br>Maybe it's nicer to hang out<br>in front of the window at home,<br><br>to stuff chips into yourself and<br>to dream about a big wide world.<br><br>No evaluation, that's possible.<br><br>But if that's the case, you<br>better go home right away.<br><br>I'm taking a break.<br><br>I'll pack the whole year's worth of stuff,<br><br>and the overtime, and then...<br><br>I'll go to the south, where it's warmer.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Maybe we could do a diving course together?<br><br>You used to be very<br>keen on diving in coral.<br><br>You're acting as if it was all decided.<br><br>It's not, is it?<br><br>God, we can't do this.<br><br>You're a big girl, Linda.<br><br>Now everything is going<br>to be completely different.<br><br>We have to think about what you're<br>going to do with the school holidays.<br><br>When do you have Easter holidays, Rieke?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Theo, is that you?<br><br>Not Theo.<br><br>Louise.<br><br>That's Theo.<br><br>They just wanted to say good night.<br><br>How are you?<br><br>I mean, what did you do today?<br><br>Hello, Rieke.<br><br>Are you still there?<br><br>Yes, yes.<br><br>We have a mega-act here.<br><br>Carlo is a great coach,<br>but he's talking so much.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Are you coming back?<br><br>Yes?<br><br>I have to finish.<br><br>I have to go to training.<br><br>I'll call you back.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Please don't tell Donga.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Maybe it's better if we<br>don't see each other again.<br><br>I'll call you back, okay?<br><br>Bye.<br><br>Bye, Rika.<br><br>Sorry, I'll be ready in a minute.<br><br>I'm excited, man.<br><br>Susu.<br><br>Now come in.<br><br>You're still going to get the dead man out.<br><br>And I thought the world would end.<br><br>Because I'll never find<br>someone like Fabian again.<br><br>Until a friend told<br>me, that true love is<br><br>usually the first love<br>for no man in the world.<br><br>You'll fall in love again and then...<br><br>then you'll have forgotten him.<br><br>You'll even be happy<br>that you're rid of him.<br><br>Don't you think so?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Well, I don't think so.<br><br>How long were you<br>together with your boyfriend?<br><br>Quite a long time.<br><br>I'm surprised.<br><br>Do you have a husband now?<br><br>A boyfriend, to be<br>precise. We're not married.<br><br>What's your boyfriend's name?<br><br>Your ex-boyfriend.<br><br>It's not that important.<br><br>Tell me, maybe I know him.<br><br>No, he's not really my boyfriend.<br><br>It's getting complicated.<br><br>What's wrong with you?<br><br>You can tell me<br>everything. I'll tell Glenn.<br><br>Promise?<br><br>It's because of my brother.<br><br>What are you doing tonight?<br><br>Are you celebrating?<br><br>Well...<br><br>If you can't stop thinking about it.<br><br>Maybe you can just come to my<br>place and we'll celebrate together.<br><br>I mean, I'd be happy.<br><br>Well, I have to go now.<br><br>That's my address.<br><br>Look, a rubber barrel.<br><br>It should have been here sooner.<br><br>And there are no wax sticks on the carpet.<br><br>There are a few technical<br>problems, but we'll get them.<br><br>By the way, Santa Claus is here.<br><br>Ta-da!<br><br>I brought you something.<br><br>Hello, Rieke! Presents!<br><br>Don't you want to see?<br><br>It wasn't easy to get.<br><br>Now wait a minute!<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>I have a date.<br><br>You? With whom?<br><br>It's none of your business.<br><br>Aha.<br><br>But we wanted to<br>celebrate together tonight.<br><br>Nils, think of the goose.<br><br>Otherwise it will be spoiled.<br><br>Can you celebrate with dad?<br><br>Who thinks about the birds in the oven now?<br><br>Man, Frederike!<br><br>That's a surprise. Come in.<br><br>I didn't expect this at all.<br><br>Give it to me.<br><br>But it's great!<br><br>Give me your jacket.<br><br>I got a visit.<br><br>But it doesn't matter,<br>we'll celebrate together.<br><br>Sigi?<br><br>This is my friend Sigi.<br>He's studying sociology.<br><br>He's doing his doctorate.<br><br>Hi, I'm Frederike.<br><br>From my class.<br><br>Ah, yes. Nice.<br><br>You're lucky, dinner's just been served.<br><br>Tell me, do you want<br>to stay here all night?<br><br>Don't be so nice, I'll give you some more.<br><br>I don't want to.<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>We've got all night for<br>that, you little rascal.<br><br>Do you like Hawaii toast?<br><br>Hawaii what?<br><br>The contract is at 6,000.<br><br>You just have to sign it.<br><br>Strange that it's all<br>supposed to be over now.<br><br>I'll have to see if I can do it<br>without getting into a fight.<br><br>It doesn't look like it.<br><br>I just don't think it's a good<br>idea to just let Christmas go.<br><br>Let it go.<br><br>Christmas is still a family holiday.<br><br>I think it's best for all of us if<br>Rieke can finally find some friends.<br><br>On your table, for every glass I drank,<br><br>for the plate you put next to yours,<br><br>it would be more natural<br>not to say good night.<br><br>Good night, friends.<br><br>It's time.<br><br>Tell me, Rieke, you have<br>exactly the same glasses as I do.<br><br>Oh, right. Can I have another one?<br><br>A cigarette.<br><br>Oh, that's nice.<br><br>Where is the bathroom?<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, it's yours.<br><br>Thank you, otherwise I always feel so old.<br><br>So you go to the hallway and<br>take the second door on the right.<br><br>I didn't come all the<br>way from Frankfurt to<br><br>spend the whole evening<br>in the kindergarten.<br><br>Stop it with your idiotry. Can't<br>you have a little understanding?<br><br>What do you mean,<br>how should I have<br><br>understanding? Have<br>some understanding for me.<br><br>Should I have sent you away again?<br><br>Yes, of course.<br><br>Then we'll see each other<br>once in the holy time and then...<br><br>And then something like<br>this. What can I do with this?<br><br>I'll go and get my brother.<br><br>Then you should fuck him.<br><br>You're kidding me.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Frederike!<br><br>We'll see each other in a new year.<br><br>Your hat!<br><br>She forgot her hat.<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>What I have to say,<br><br>takes a cigarette<br><br>and a last glass standing.<br><br>No, it's really expensive.<br><br>I mean, the city is terribly loud and big<br><br>and the people are pretty cheeky.<br><br>Since Bavaria.<br><br>Great.<br><br>No.<br><br>But that's okay.<br><br>When are you leaving again?<br><br>What?<br><br>When are you going to Germany?<br><br>New year.<br><br>I got the stuff here in the mail.<br><br>Dad took care of everything.<br><br>Luise.<br><br>So you won't forget me.<br><br>Well, then I have two rooms now.<br><br>That's pretty good, too.<br><br>And we can visit each<br>other from time to time.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>In the Easter holidays, maybe.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>We'll get you an apartment.<br><br>Then you'll come visit me.<br><br>And then we'll make the city unsafe.<br><br>It'll be funny.<br><br>Not because of Enrique.<br><br>Just because it's so beautiful right now.<br><br>It's over.<br><br>See? Come on.<br><br>Ah! Let me down!<br><br>Woohoo!<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>Woohoo!<br><br>Hey, this is so crazy here! The<br>nature here, this is a real honor!<br><br>Dick, I have a totally<br>crazy idea! I'm staying here!<br><br>Oh, come on, stop it, you idiot!<br><br>It's crazy, but I don't<br>feel like Munich at all!<br><br>Munich is crap, what am<br>I supposed to do there?<br><br>It's good, Nils, stop it!<br><br>That's what I mean!<br>We can start over again!<br><br>Next season is Olympia, it would be...<br><br>It's over, Nils!<br><br>Who says so?<br><br>Dad says everything is<br>decided, so everything is decided!<br><br>Dad! I'm 19, I can do whatever I want!<br><br>I won't let dad tell me anything!<br><br>Besides, I haven't signed the contract yet!<br><br>What?<br><br>The contract!<br><br>I haven't signed the contract yet!<br><br>Or you don't feel like it anymore?<br><br>It's no fun, Nils!<br><br>It's no fun?<br><br>We'll tell dad!<br><br>We just have to find the right moment!<br><br>So, who is it?<br><br>We need alcohol.<br><br>Absolutely alcohol.<br><br>What's dad drinking?<br><br>Something high in proportion.<br><br>What's he drinking?<br><br>Apple cider vinegar.<br><br>It's written on the front.<br><br>Apple cider vinegar.<br><br>That's very, very good.<br><br>What's up with the bride?<br><br>I think Lydia has a sharp tooth.<br><br>She's not as great as she looks.<br><br>I mean, character-wise.<br><br>Right.<br><br>You didn't get a high score on her.<br><br>Neither Nils' room is over<br>there. Federica will get that, too.<br><br>I thought you didn't want to celebrate.<br><br>We have a visitor.<br><br>Who are they?<br><br>They're still the same.<br><br>Culture Girls, I'm from Berlin.<br><br>Culture Girls.<br><br>Nice, very beautiful.<br><br>You have to talk to him right now.<br><br>If we wait any longer,<br>it won't be worth it.<br><br>He's going completely crazy.<br><br>That's a nice one.<br><br>Dad, this might be an unfavorable<br>moment, but I have to talk to you.<br><br>Nils won't go to Munich.<br><br>Well, not to Munich today.<br><br>He drank way too much.<br><br>You know what, Rieke?<br><br>Hey, Rieke, I'm so looking<br>forward to the new year.<br><br>I think a lot will change here.<br><br>I've never experienced that before.<br><br>But your brother is so sweet.<br><br>Totally cute.<br><br>Lydia Pascal falls in<br>love with her partner.<br><br>If the press finds out, there<br>will be a huge commotion.<br><br>Well, but you don't have<br>to apologize for love.<br><br>It's possible.<br><br>But Nils won't come<br>with you. He'll stay here.<br><br>But he didn't say anything to Sonja.<br><br>Then that's enough.<br><br>I think you'll like it better.<br><br>I don't think so.<br><br>You can ask him.<br><br>I don't need to. He already<br>signed the next contract.<br><br>Oh, crap.<br><br>I'm really sorry. It wasn't fair.<br><br>But I thought he told you already.<br><br>Don't look at me like that.<br>I'm not the bad one here.<br><br>Stop this shit!<br><br>You think you can fool<br>everyone, but you're wrong!<br><br>I only told you that I fell in<br>love with your brother, okay?<br><br>Is that forbidden?<br><br>Oh, yeah, because of<br>whom? In love, you stupid slut!<br><br>What do you know about love?<br><br>More than you think!<br><br>At least more than you!<br><br>Why are you destroying everything?<br><br>What's wrong, Casanova?<br><br>I just don't think it's<br>okay that you're just<br><br>sneaking in without<br>telling me beforehand.<br><br>You ran away from<br>Munich without telling me.<br><br>And that's not okay.<br><br>Oh, that was just because...<br><br>Yeah. I know why.<br><br>I think you have to talk to your<br>little sister. She's totally going crazy.<br><br>What did she do?<br><br>She said you wanted to stay here.<br><br>Talk to her.<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>She's totally crazy, really.<br><br>What's up?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Just say it.<br><br>You don't want to stay here, do you?<br><br>I do.<br><br>Didn't I tell you?<br><br>Yes, yes. You did.<br><br>I have no idea why she's showing up here.<br><br>It was not planned at all.<br><br>Do you like her?<br><br>You like her.<br><br>Watch out for tomorrow's<br>breakfast, I'm telling you.<br><br>And dad too.<br><br>He's totally crazy lately.<br><br>Promised?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Promised?<br><br>Promised!<br><br>Promised!<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>No. They're all still awake.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Drive!<br><br>Shit!<br><br>Go back in!<br><br>Go back in!

	<h1>Our Wife (1941) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Jerry Marvin, a talented musician and composer, wallows in drunken self-pity after he is divorced by his wife Babe. Along comes new love Susan, who rescues Jerry and provides him with fresh inspiration to complete his trumpet concerto. He performs it, it's a hit, and the jubilant Jerry and Susan plan to marry. There's just one hitch: Now Babe wants him back... and the unscrupulous ex-wife will stop at nothing to recapture her man.</p>

Maybe after the concert.<br><br>Thank you, ma'am.<br><br>Oh, you won't need a key, ma'am,<br>this man-eating monster will protect you.<br><br>Did my father...<br><br>Is there a ticket left for me...<br>the name is Drake, Miss Susan Drake?<br><br>- Yes, ma'am.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Sorry, but you'll have to wait<br>till the number's over.<br><br>- Oh, please.<br>- Sorry.<br><br>But I won't make a disturbance,<br>I'll be very quiet.<br><br>That's my orders.<br><br>But I'm a very good friend<br>of Mr. Marvin's.<br><br>I'm sorry, ma'am.<br><br>- Could I just listen here?<br>- Sure, lady.<br><br>- He's pretty good, isn't he?<br>- Pretty good?<br><br>- You really think so?<br>- Don't you?<br><br>Oh, I think he's wonderful.<br><br>Say, I've been on this door a great many<br>years and I know a hit when I hear one.<br><br>This guy is a hit.<br><br>Sorry, ma'am, you'll have to wait<br>till this number's over.<br><br>Well, there's nothing on this ticket<br>that forces me...<br><br>...to stay out here until the<br>number's over.<br><br>- Sorry, ma'am, orders.<br>- I'm Mrs. Jerome Marvin,<br><br>the composer's wife.<br><br>If my own wife came late,<br>I couldn't let her in.<br><br>My wife's bigger and stronger than I am,<br>she ain't bashful about letting me know it.<br><br>I don't get around to these concerts much.<br>What do you do in a case like this?<br><br>You just wait.<br><br>Seems to me a wife should be able to listen<br>to her own husband blow his horn.<br><br>Well, don't look at me, lady.<br><br>After the revolution and I own<br>this joint, I'll let you in.<br><br>- Cigarette?<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Used to burn me to have<br>my performances interrupted.<br><br>I can understand that.<br><br>Neither had they ever taught me<br>to come on time for anybody else's.<br><br>You're not a professional yourself?<br><br>Well, in a sense, yes.<br><br>But my performances aren't very intriguing,<br>consequently I have very little audience.<br><br>That's too bad.<br>Wait till you get up in the big time.<br><br>- Big time?<br>- The tops, honey.<br><br>Don't you be discouraged,<br>just keep at it.<br><br>You look like you got plenty<br>on the ball.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Do you mind?<br><br>Say, that husband of mine's<br>doing pretty good.<br><br>Pretty good?<br><br>Doing alright.<br><br>I always knew he had it in him.<br><br>Who was it said, to know a man<br>you've got to live with him?<br><br>Was it Pickwick?<br><br>Oh, I've got to tell that to Jerry,<br>he's got a great sense of humor.<br><br>Most men have, once in a while.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>He tears civilized veneer<br>right off music.<br><br>He's mixed Americana with African<br>so well you can't tell.<br><br>So savage, it was wonderful,<br>don't you think?<br><br>Susan, where have you been?<br>Anything wrong?<br><br>No, no, nothing. Dr. Hogarth<br>detained me...<br><br>...and the doorman wouldn't let<br>me in until intermission.<br><br>That's too bad. Jerry's doing<br>himself proud.<br><br>Wasn't he wonderful, I had no idea a man<br>could get such music out of a trumpet.<br><br>We'll have to go backstage<br>and congratulate him.<br><br>- No, no, I'd rather not.<br>- Why not?<br><br>- Let's take our seats.<br>- Susan, it's the right thing to do.<br><br>Who sharpened his pencils<br>when they were dull? I did.<br><br>And who lay awake night after night<br>listening to him toot that horn?<br><br>I did.<br><br>And now it's a night for us to howl<br>and what happens?<br><br>I'm rushed off to bed.<br><br>Aren't you all in bed?<br><br>I've given up all hope for<br>the two of you.<br><br>When you can refuse to go backstage<br>even to congratulate a friend...<br><br>on the night of his greatest triumph,<br>you're still intellectual snobs. You...<br><br>- What's wrong with you two?<br>- Oh, go to bed, Tom.<br><br>Not until after Jerry gets here.<br><br>I sometimes think there must have been a<br>mix-up at the hospital when you were born...<br><br>...and we got the wrong brat.<br><br>That still doesn't explain<br>what brought this on.<br><br>What brought what on?<br><br>This frost, this dry ice,<br>this sub-zero cold wave.<br><br>What the devil are you talking about?<br><br>Never mind, I just killed myself.<br><br>I'm dead, I never asked a question,<br>it was all a myth.<br><br>Susan, you'll always be my<br>favorite daughter.<br><br>Good night, Dad.<br><br>I'm going to wait up a little while<br>see if comes.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- Tom.<br>- Hm?<br><br>Jerry's ex-wife was at the<br>music hall tonight.<br><br>Oh, she was. Well, I bet she went<br>backstage to see Jerry.<br><br>That's why Susan didn't go.<br>She was afraid she might be intruding...<br><br>...since the divorce is not final yet.<br><br>Well, I still can't underst...<br><br>You... you mean Susan and Jerry?<br><br>Go ahead, Dad, and don't put<br>any sentiment into it.<br><br>Very tempting.<br><br>I beg your pardon. Mr. Marvin still<br>lives here, doesn't he?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Well, I'm Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>- May I come in and wait for him?<br>- Of course.<br><br>You do expect him. I missed him<br>at the music hall and...<br><br>Of, course, I knew I'd seen you before.<br><br>You're the girl in the lobby.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Imagine us meeting that way.<br><br>I mean, both of us sort of<br>in the same boat.<br><br>- Late for the concert.<br>- Yes, it was odd.<br><br>My woman's intuition certainly<br>wasn't working tonight.<br><br>Well, there are two schools of thought<br>on woman's intuition.<br><br>Is that so?<br><br>You're clever, aren't you?<br><br>But that's to be expected.<br><br>Jerry always liked brains around him.<br><br>Well, everything looks just the same.<br><br>- Oh, we haven't changed anything.<br>- Been staying here long?<br><br>- Since June.<br>- Six weeks.<br><br>Doesn't it bore you?<br><br>I mean, being way out here<br>so far from town.<br><br>Well, we like it any place just<br>so long as we can be together.<br><br>How very cozy.<br><br>Susan.<br><br>Oh, this is Tom, he lives here<br>as does my father.<br><br>Tom, this is Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Well... well, so you're Mrs. Marvin, I...<br><br>- We expect Jerry any minute now.<br>- Well, don't.<br><br>- Why? He is coming home.<br>- Oh, yes, but not right away.<br><br>You see, I know Jerry.<br><br>There's nothing like being married<br>to a man to find out about him.<br><br>Right now he's at Reuben's.<br><br>Every time he's had a successful opening<br>he always goes to Reuben's first.<br><br>The boys and the sturgeon sandwich.<br><br>Then it's Lindy's. The boys<br>and the chicken liver sandwich.<br><br>It's been going on for years.<br><br>Look here, there's no sense in your losing<br>any sleep on my account.<br><br>You don't have to wait up with me.<br><br>- We don't mind.<br>- No, it's a pleasure.<br><br>Oh, please, run along to bed.<br>I don't mind waiting up for him.<br><br>After all, it isn't as though I were<br>a stranger in a strange house.<br><br>Well, if you'll excuse us, good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Hello, I...<br><br>Hello, darling.<br><br>Well, well, well.<br><br>I'm sorry I haven't a fatted<br>calf to kill.<br><br>I don't think that's amusing, darling.<br><br>Babe, why did you come back?<br><br>For a very ordinary reason.<br><br>- I love you, I want to be your wife.<br>- All of this so sudden.<br><br>You know, Jerry, I was very young<br>when you married me.<br><br>- I wasn't exactly Methuselah myself.<br>- You were my first love.<br><br>Yeah, I suppose you had to make<br>a start somewhere.<br><br>A girl who's known only one man<br>is inclined to go off...<br><br>...and search for something<br>she thinks she's missed.<br><br>- Oh, Babe.<br>- But I came home to you.<br><br>Oh, please, please, darling.<br><br>Put out the welcome mat in front<br>of the door for Baby.<br><br>The same old Babe.<br><br>Thinks all she has to do is crook her<br>little finger and along comes Jerry.<br><br>I was at your concert tonight.<br><br>If you feel you were cheated, I can<br>refund you the price of your ticket.<br><br>I don't know much about music,<br>were you good?<br><br>Suppose you read the reviews<br>on your way home?<br><br>And before you go, the key, please.<br><br>You know the judge gave me the house.<br><br>I've missed you, Jerry,<br>missed you like the very devil.<br><br>When did you begin to pine for me?<br><br>Right after the concert?<br><br>I'll lay odds you called<br>your attorney first...<br><br>...asking if there was any money<br>in composing music.<br><br>Would you believe me if I told you<br>that I've learned my lesson?<br><br>I love you, Jerry.<br><br>I loved you when I asked<br>for the divorce.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry I came.<br><br>I'm sorry I came to beg forgiveness<br>for hurting you.<br><br>I'm not sorry you hurt me.<br><br>Oh, darling...<br><br>No, because if you hadn't, there wouldn't<br>have been any symphony as you call it.<br><br>You were a sort of a reverse<br>inspiration.<br><br>You know, you heard my stuff tonight...<br><br>but I'll give you a mattress filled with<br>diamonds and rubis if you understood it.<br><br>I understood one thing, Jerry.<br><br>It was my man up there on that platform<br>making music for me.<br><br>In spite of you, Babe, in spite of you.<br><br>You know that place in the music<br>where it goes...<br><br>Let me explain it to you.<br><br>A man meets a woman,<br>it's not a very rare thing,<br><br>but this guy was dope enough<br>to believe it was.<br><br>That symphony is about me.<br><br>Yeah, from your laquered toe-nails<br>to your shellacked hairdo.<br><br>All the way from the marriage ceremony...<br><br>...through those diamond-studded gutters<br>to the divorce courts.<br><br>- Thanks, Jerry.<br>- No, thank you, Babe.<br><br>Because every time I get<br>a little discouraged,<br><br>...I'll just remember that you said<br>I couldn't do it.<br><br>All I was worth was leading a<br>high-hatted, long-tail dinner band.<br><br>Making music for a lot of fat-hip,<br>frustrated witches.<br><br>You said I couldn't do it,<br>Babe, and I did it.<br><br>Now I'm glad I came.<br><br>There are a lot of ways of telling<br>me you love me.<br><br>And if I remember rightly, you used<br>quite a few of them in your time.<br><br>But this is really something.<br><br>Oh, yes, Jerry, you wrote a symphony,<br>in spite of me, against me,<br><br>well, in spite of against, they aren't<br>far apart.<br><br>You had to think about me<br>a lot to do it.<br><br>It's like that old wheeze about<br>love and hate being the same.<br><br>Before I forget it, Babe, the key, please.<br><br>Quit howling like a banshee in the night,<br>Jerry, you still love me.<br><br>Wait a minute, I'll be right back.<br><br>Susan.<br><br>Oh, Jerry, you were splendid tonight,<br>I knew you would be.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Susan...<br><br>Will you come downstairs for a minute?<br><br>Please, I want to talk to you.<br><br>I want to ask you a question before<br>the customary introduction.<br><br>Yes, Jerry.<br><br>I've been thinking of this<br>for quite a while.<br><br>Susan, do you remember<br>the night we met?<br><br>Yes, I...<br><br>I asked you to stop making noises<br>on that horn so I could work.<br><br>And I heard music in your voice.<br><br>And then we quarrelled and...<br>I heard more music.<br><br>Then I thought I could go back to Cristobal,<br>but I couldn't because...<br><br>...when you left, the music went with you.<br><br>Susan, will you marry me?<br><br>Why, of course, Jerry.<br><br>My fianc?e, Miss Susan Drake.<br><br>- My wife, Miss Jerome Marvin.<br>- We've already met.<br><br>I wanted you to be the first<br>to know, Babe.<br><br>I think I approve.<br>She's very lovely.<br><br>Your approval makes<br>my happiness complete.<br><br>There's a great deal I could tell you about<br>Jerry that would make things easier for you.<br><br>But that would be taking<br>the fun about it.<br><br>May I wish you luck?<br>Very much luck.<br><br>Surprised, aren't you, Jerry?<br><br>You didn't think I could lose gracefully.<br><br>Well, I can. It hurts like the devil.<br><br>Right now there's nothing in the world<br>i want more than to be your wife.<br><br>So I'd better get out of here<br>while I'm still a lady.<br><br>Thanks, Jerry.<br><br>Do you mind if I go upstairs and get<br>some of the personal things I left behind?<br><br>- It's very little to ask.<br>- No, I don't mind, go right ahead, Babe.<br><br>I hope I said the right things,<br>you wanted me to accept you, didn't you?<br><br>That's why I asked you.<br><br>Well, she'll probably leave<br>you alone now.<br><br>Though I couldn't help feeling<br>sorry for her.<br><br>Everybody feels sorry for Babe.<br><br>You start out doing that and you wind up<br>with everybody feeling sorry for you.<br><br>Well, good night.<br><br>Susan, I've been thinking of this<br>for quite a while.<br><br>Do you remember the first<br>night we met?<br><br>Yes, I wanted you to stop<br>making noises on that h...<br><br>I said that before.<br><br>- I heard music in your voice.<br>- Wait a minute,<br><br>there's nobody's here with us now.<br><br>Will you please give me the courtesy<br>of not interrupting me?<br><br>I heard music in your voice.<br><br>We quarrelled and I heard more music.<br><br>Then I thought I could go back<br>to Cristobal, but I couldn't...<br><br>...because when you left, the music<br>all went with you.<br><br>Susan, will you marry me?<br><br>Will you?<br><br>I'll answer you the moment<br>I stop crying.<br><br>Well, I...<br><br>I think it's only fair for you to know I'm<br>a bad cook and I darn socks abominably.<br><br>I'd stop eating and go barefoot,<br>there isn't anything I wouldn't do.<br><br>- Do you love me?<br>- I'm just a little bit insane about you.<br><br>If you wouldn't have asked me,<br>I'd have asked you.<br><br>You'd never have gotten away from me.<br><br>Is that a nice way<br>for a girl to talk?<br><br>No, it isn't, you should be<br>talking that way.<br><br>Ooh...<br><br>Ooh...<br><br>Babe, are you hurt?<br><br>Oh, please... ooh...<br><br>- What happened?<br>- I... I slipped.<br><br>- Let me help you up.<br>- Oh, my back!<br><br>Something's happened.<br><br>I don't think you'd better move her<br>till we have a doctor.<br><br>Dr. Mandel, please. I want you<br>to tell me the truth.<br><br>What's the matter with me?<br><br>You're suffering from shock.<br>Oh, nothing organically wrong.<br><br>But shock can produce severe conditions.<br><br>- And in your case...<br>- It's my legs, isn't it?<br><br>Only temporarily, Babe.<br><br>Oh, gosh...<br><br>A week, a month.<br><br>A week?<br><br>A month?<br><br>I can't stay here.<br><br>Jerry, this accident is my<br>misfortune, not yours.<br><br>- Babe, please.<br>- What am I going to do?<br><br>Oh, I'm so alone. Where am I<br>going to go, Jerry?<br><br>Oh, Jerry, I know I shouldn't<br>stay here, but please.<br><br>Please don't send me away.<br><br>Let me stay here until I can<br>pull myself together.<br><br>Jerry, she'll have you for<br>the rest of your life.<br><br>Give me a little time.<br><br>Babe, Babe, you mustn't excite yourself.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>Please forget what I said.<br><br>You'll feel much better in the morning<br>after a good night's sleep.<br><br>These belong to Mrs. Marvin.<br>She dropped them on the steps.<br><br>She'll need a nurse too.<br><br>Jerry, please call Hattie.<br><br>Hattie's my maid. She's better for me<br>than any old hard-boiled nurse.<br><br>All right, I'll call her.<br>Is it okay with you, Frank?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I'll leave her these sleeping tablets.<br>Give her two of them.<br><br>Yes, doctor.<br><br>Good night, Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night, Babe, see you in the morning.<br><br>- Jerry.<br>- I'll make her comfortable.<br><br>I don't suppose it'll make you feel any<br>better if I told you how sorry I am.<br><br>By all the rules, I should hate you.<br><br>Well, if it will help, I wish you would.<br><br>I'll try like the devil, Susan.<br><br>- May I call you Susan?<br>- Of course.<br><br>- Is this too warm?<br>- Yes, please.<br><br>Leave that one on, please.<br><br>Is there anything else<br>you want before I go?<br><br>Please don't leave me.<br>I get the jitters lying here alone.<br><br>I start to think and begin<br>feeling sorry for myself.<br><br>And there's nothing sorrier<br>than Babe feeling sorry for herself.<br><br>Poor Jerry, he always plays that<br>way when he's upset.<br><br>- Shall I ask him to stop?<br>- On, no don't disturb him.<br><br>It doesn't bother me.<br><br>Jerry always said I was selfish<br>and I guess I am.<br><br>You're tired and sleepy and I make<br>you sit here just the same.<br><br>I don't mind.<br><br>Please go to bed, I'd feel better<br>if you did.<br><br>I'll buzz if I need anything.<br><br>Jerry's downstairs, he'll hear if I buzz.<br><br>Where's the buzzer?<br><br>There it is.<br><br>Thank you, you've been very sweet.<br><br>- Good night.<br>- Good night.<br><br>No, don't put on the light, Dad.<br><br>- Healthy animal.<br>- I wish I were more like him.<br><br>Mind if I take you as you are?<br><br>It's an awful mess, isn't it, Dad?<br><br>- It could be worse.<br>- It is.<br><br>Jerry asked me to marry him<br>and I accepted.<br><br>Hm, it is worse.<br><br>It was different before I knew her.<br><br>Even now after I met her didn't make<br>so much difference, but now...<br><br>Not very sporting competing<br>with a woman who is helpless.<br><br>Dad, you know what I think.<br><br>Certainly, that we'd better<br>get out of here.<br><br>Yes, we'd better get out of here.<br><br>Because my heart and not my good sense<br>is involved with Jerry.<br><br>It keeps saying, don't go, you've got him<br>to heck with all decency.<br><br>So, I think I'd better go.<br><br>Am I still your favorite daughter?<br><br>Right this minute I'm so proud of you,<br>I'd like to wake up Tom up...<br><br>...and give him a good thrashing<br>for not being another girl like you.<br><br>- Good night, Dad.<br>- Good night, Susan.<br><br>- Where are you going to sleep?<br>- In the guest room.<br><br>Oh, I forgot a robe and nightgown.<br><br>Hate to disturb her,<br>she's probably asleep.<br><br>Oh... oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>I thought you were asleep.<br><br>- I forgot a nightie.<br>- Oh, yes, this is your room.<br><br>I'm sorry to put you out.<br><br>I felt like the wreck of the Hesperus<br>the minute I looked at you.<br><br>I thought if I fixed myself up a little.<br><br>Most women take their make-up off<br>before going to bed.<br><br>I make sure mine's on just right.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Dad.<br><br>- Dad.<br>- What's the matter, what's the matter?<br><br>- There's nothing wrong with her.<br>- What?<br><br>Mrs. Marvin the first can walk,<br>she's a faker.<br><br>What makes you say that?<br><br>I put her bag with her lipstick<br>and compact...<br><br>...on the dresser, twenty feet<br>away from the bed.<br><br>Nobody was in that room after I left.<br><br>We were in this room, Jerry was<br>downstairs, I could hear him playing.<br><br>And when I went back in there,<br>she was using the lipstick and compact.<br><br>- But two doctors have examined her...<br>- Yes, I know.<br><br>I was there, I'll admit she has nerves,<br><br>she didn't even flinch<br>when they stuck pins in her.<br><br>But just the same, she's pretending<br>to be hurt so she can stay here.<br><br>Susan, for that stupid, jealous remark,<br>I'll report you to the Medical Association.<br><br>They'll put pickets around the house.<br><br>It's a serious accusation, Susan,<br>are you sure?<br><br>- I'm positive.<br>- Have you told Jerry?<br><br>No. I tried to, but I couldn't.<br>I've got to prove it.<br><br>How?<br><br>I don't know, but I'll make<br>her give herself away.<br><br>She's a very clever girl, Susan,<br>she's proven that.<br><br>Well, if she had twice the cunning<br>and three times the charm,<br><br>I'd still expose her, and in front<br>of Jerry too.<br><br>Well, it's every woman for herself<br>from now on.<br><br>And I'm betting on you, Suzie Q.<br><br>Get this one.<br><br>There came to the music Hall tonight<br>a man and his trumpet.<br><br>And...<br><br>Oh, this will warm the cockles<br>of your trumpet's heart.<br><br>- Jerry!<br>- Huh?<br><br>- This is your day to howl.<br>- Tom!<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot for a minute.<br><br>All your life I've tried to teach you<br>to curb your tongue.<br><br>Well, I suppose every man<br>should be permitted one failure.<br><br>And you are mine.<br><br>Breakfast is ready whenever<br>you wants it, Mr. Marvin.<br><br>- We'll wait for Miss Drake.<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>- Good morning, you're Hattie, aren't you?<br>- Yessum.<br><br>- Good morning, Jerry?<br>- Good morning.<br><br>How's the patient this morning?<br><br>She seems to be fairly comfortable.<br><br>Oh, don't be upset, she'll be all right.<br><br>She'll be able to walk and before<br>very long too.<br><br>- I hope you're right.<br>- I know it, dear, I know it.<br><br>- Have you read Jerry's reviews?<br>- No, are they good?<br><br>Oh, let's have some breakfast first,<br>I'm famished.<br><br>Bring the papers along,<br>we'll read them in here.<br><br>Wow, what a night.<br><br>To top everything else,<br>our cook's sick this morning.<br><br>- I'll get breakfast.<br>- No, Hattie's got everything ready.<br><br>Oh, how nice of her.<br><br>- What would you like, eggs, bacon?<br>- Can I have my coffee now, please?<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>Go on, Hattie, see what Mrs. Marvin<br>wants, I'll get the coffee.<br><br>- Oh, let me get it.<br>- No, no, I'll get it.<br><br>The little lady certainly requires<br>a lot of attention, doesn't she?<br><br>Oh, have you thought of any plan<br>of getting her out of bed yet?<br><br>Oh, I've thought of a thousand<br>and one things, I tossed all night.<br><br>- You don't look it.<br>- This brightness came out of a compact.<br><br>Something I learned from Babe.<br><br>Say, why don't you sprinkle flour<br>on the floor around her bed?<br><br>Then, when she gets up,<br>she leaves her footprints.<br><br>Well, I've thought of sprinkling<br>ground glass on her food.<br><br>- What's wrong with that?<br>- Children.<br><br>Susan, I think you're being very unfair to<br>Jerry not telling him what you suspect.<br><br>But, Dad, I told you she...<br><br>Did you read that the common<br>cold costs the United States...<br><br>...five billion dollars in labor<br>hours alone?<br><br>And that's not adding in the cost<br>of nose drops either.<br><br>I hand't read that.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Hm-hmm.<br><br>- I'll take it, Mr. Marvin.<br>- Oh, thanks, Hattie.<br><br>Buzz, buzz, buzz, I can't ever<br>get a job done.<br><br>Poor Hattie. That buzzer's been going<br>ever since she got here.<br><br>- I've got it, I've got it!<br>- Hm? Got what?<br><br>Uh... oh, the answer to that formula<br>I've been working on.<br><br>- You know what I mean, Dad.<br>- Yes, I know.<br><br>Will you excuse me, please?<br><br>All of her ideas come to her<br>just like that.<br><br>Good morning, good morning,<br>how's our patient this morning?<br><br>A little better.<br><br>Has anyone ever told you<br>how beautiful you are?<br><br>Oh, you're just trying to make<br>me feel good. You have.<br><br>Hattie, what are you doing?<br><br>I'm trying to select a bed jacket.<br>Susan, help me pick one.<br><br>Oh, I think this one's very attractive.<br><br>Hattie, the men are starving,<br>you get breakfast, I'll help Miss Marvin.<br><br>- Yessum.<br>- Aren't you suppesed to be working...<br><br>- ...at the university or something?<br>- Yes, but... Oh, dear.<br><br>I want to be where I do the most good.<br><br>There, easy.<br>Careful with your back.<br><br>Oh... Hattie's really all I need.<br>She always takes care of me.<br><br>Oh, I imagine Harriet was very efficient<br>when the care you needed was just routine.<br><br>But this is an extraordinary occasion.<br>I really don't mind keeping an eye on you.<br><br>I don't want to keep you<br>from your work.<br><br>Don't you worry about that. This is just<br>as big a job as smashing a few atoms.<br><br>After all, we only pass through<br>this life once and...<br><br>any little kindness we can leave along<br>the way should be... left along the way.<br><br>There, now I'll have Hattie bring up<br>your tray right away.<br><br>What's up?<br><br>- Where's Jerry?<br>- In the kitchen.<br><br>You must help me keep him and Hattie<br>downstairs until the buzzer rings.<br><br>- Why?<br>- Well, it's very simple.<br><br>She's always ringing for Hattie,<br>isn't she?<br><br>- Uh-huh.<br>- What's that got to do with it?<br><br>Well, I moved the buzzer just<br>beyond her reach.<br><br>Not far enough for her to<br>become suspicious,<br><br>just so far enough so that she'll have<br>to get out of bed to ring.<br><br>- So the next time she buzzes...<br>- Is this my daughter Susan?<br><br>My honest and honorable child,<br>my sedate and dignified offspring?<br><br>That I should live to see her<br>degrade herself to...<br><br>Are you sure the buzzer's<br>far enough away from the bed?<br><br>Positive.<br><br>Really, Susan, you should read<br>the reviews on Jerry's concert.<br><br>Oh, I know they're good.<br>They are, aren't they, darling?<br><br>Sure, very good.<br><br>Would you like to have me read<br>them for you?<br><br>Yes, please do, Tom, read them well<br>and slowly, I want to hear every word.<br><br>Hattie!<br><br>"Tonight we heard Jerry Marvin tear away<br>the civilized veneer of mental gymnastics.<br><br>He said with music, here is a soul, base,<br>human, vile and saintly in turn.<br><br>- Good critic, he knows music.<br>- Oh, Jerry, you're wonderful.<br><br>Only in a conservative way.<br><br>- The bell, it's a bell.<br>- Yes, Susan.<br><br>The telephone. What's so unusual<br>about that?<br><br>Uh... nothing.<br><br>Only someone should answer it, that's why<br>it's ringing, so someone will answer it.<br><br>- I'll answer it.<br>- Well, it might be important.<br><br>It's the suspense that's killing me,<br>why doesn't she ring?<br><br>- Perhaps she can't walk.<br>- Yes, she can!<br><br>It's the laundry woman. Something about<br>a missing shirt or something.<br><br>Would you like to hear me read<br>the rest of this review?<br><br>Oh, yes, go through them all.<br><br>And Jerry, you must start a clipping book.<br><br>We'll put all the good ones in the front<br>and the bad ones in the back.<br><br>- Why put them in at all?<br>- Is there anything else, ma'am?<br><br>- No, thank you.<br>- Then I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray up now.<br><br>Oh, do you mind if I check it?<br><br>No, ma'am.<br><br>Let me see, the mayonnaise cream,<br>eggs, coffee.<br><br>Oh, Hattie, no toast, you must<br>prepare some toast immediately.<br><br>But Mrs. Marvin never takes toast<br>for breakfast, ma'am.<br><br>You remember that, don't you,<br>Mr. Marvin?<br><br>- That's right, she never takes toast.<br>- Oh, well, all right.<br><br>Oh, Hattie, is the coffee hot?<br><br>Oh... I'm sorry... it's my fault entirely.<br><br>How clumsy, I seem so jittery<br>this morning.<br><br>Well, I'll go and explain to Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Hattie, you prepare another tray.<br><br>Hattie, is that you?<br><br>Hattie!<br><br>She was sleeping like a little baby.<br><br>Oh, you'll have plenty of time<br>to fix another tray,<br><br>- so would you get me some hot coffee?<br>- Yes, ma'am.<br><br>I'd like another cup of coffee too, please.<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>This is the best coffee we've had<br>since the boat.<br><br>I resent that.<br><br>Oh, deep down inside you know<br>you're no cook.<br><br>The inside of me resents that.<br><br>Jerry, they're trying to discourage<br>you from marrying me.<br><br>Sir, your daughter has informed me<br>that she can neither sew nor cook.<br><br>She's the soul of honesty.<br><br>Oh, dear, dear, take deep breaths.<br><br>How many times have I told you<br>not to gulp?<br><br>The buzzer.<br><br>Mrs. Marvin rang.<br><br>She wants her breakfast.<br><br>- Hattie, I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray.<br>- Yes, ma'am, I'll get the coffee.<br><br>- Come on, Jerry.<br>- Oh, excuse us.<br><br>- What's the hurry?<br>- I have a little surprise for you.<br><br>Let me take it.<br><br>Come in!<br>What happened to you?<br><br>Oh, I thought it was Hattie.<br><br>She was going to bring my coffee<br>half an hour ago.<br><br>It was my fault, I upset the first tray.<br><br>- Why didn't you ring, dear?<br>- I did.<br><br>But how could you?<br><br>Look where the bell is, you couldn't<br>possibly reach it without get...<br><br>Oh, I used this.<br><br>Hattie should have known better than<br>to put the table that far from you.<br><br>I guess it was my fault, I...<br><br>If you'll excuse me, I have a job<br>I have to take care of...<br><br>I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Hogarth.<br><br>- I didn't mean to be late, but...<br>- It's quite all right, Miss Drake.<br><br>Your father called this morning<br>and explained.<br><br>Nasty fall. Mrs. Marvin is quite<br>young, isn't she?<br><br>I'd just like to start you out on isolating<br>the lithium-6 atom, if you can do that.<br><br>Dr. Hogarth, you once worked<br>on nerve paralysis.<br><br>Would you come out and<br>examine Mrs. Marvin?<br><br>Oh, my dear girl, the last patient<br>I examined wore a bustle.<br><br>Now, if we can isolate the lithium-6 atom,<br><br>and then find a dye to carry it<br>direct to the cancer tissue...<br><br>But I'm sure if you looked<br>at Mrs. Marvin...<br><br>Oh, I think that the doctors called in<br>on the case are very capable.<br><br>Yes, they're all under seventy.<br><br>I beg your pardon.<br><br>Naturally I know paralysis can be<br>subconsciously induced.<br><br>But what are the chances of...<br>well, of faking?<br><br>Endless. I had a case once.<br><br>Astonishing. Not even a quiver<br>when jabbed with a pin.<br><br>An astounding display of...<br>of willpower.<br><br>I tried all the scientifical methods.<br>I even tried hypnotism.<br><br>But the patient was too wily.<br><br>I finally made him walk.<br><br>I wonder if we took a solution<br>both of lithium-6 and borom-10...<br><br>How did you make him walk,<br>what was the treatment?<br><br>You won't repeat this<br>because it wasn't quite ethical.<br><br>- Of course not.<br>- I got him drunk.<br><br>Of course I had to drink with him.<br><br>But I took aspirin to counteract<br>the stimulant.<br><br>He not only walked, he offered<br>to fight John L. Sullivan.<br><br>Thank you, Hattie, that's all.<br><br>Look what I found, champagne.<br><br>Where did you get that?<br><br>I found it in the cupboard<br>when I straightened them out.<br><br>Thought we might have<br>a little drink together.<br><br>How nice.<br><br>How about the others?<br><br>Oh, Dad and Tom have gone<br>to get Jerry.<br><br>You like champagne, don't you?<br><br>It's my favorite drink,<br>it always makes me very gay.<br><br>Oh, it's a pity I didn't think<br>of it sooner.<br><br>What shall we drink to?<br><br>How about to us?<br><br>- The old wife out, the new one in.<br>- Oh, no, that's too cruel.<br><br>Why? Why can't women be like men?<br><br>They always drink to the last man to go.<br><br>Come on, let's hoist a mug<br>to the last woman to go.<br><br>- Me.<br>- All right, I'll drink to you, Babe.<br><br>But I refuse to drink to your past.<br>To your future.<br><br>And the nice man you'll meet, and marry<br>and live happily ever after with.<br><br>There's just a slight technical<br>reservation, Susan.<br><br>Most men when they do their courting,<br><br>like their women with the normal<br>number of legs so they can dance.<br><br>You'll dance, darling, I can see you<br>in his arms now.<br><br>- Ask him his name and address.<br>- Can't you see him?<br><br>You'd better have another drink...<br><br>...and you'll be clairvoyant too.<br><br>Excuse me. This is good,<br>it's very good.<br><br>The more I drink of this, the more<br>I see the long dreary years...<br><br>...stretching in front of me.<br><br>Oh, your legs, your pretty legs.<br><br>I'll wager the millions of men that saw them<br>on the stage are weeping tonight.<br><br>- What do you know about men?<br>- Not much.<br><br>- But I'm willing to learn.<br>- They're all alike.<br><br>Some are a little more housebroken<br>than others.<br><br>But they weep for no woman.<br><br>Except Jerry.<br><br>Let's drink to Jerry.<br><br>To Jerry.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry I let my bitterness<br>get the best of me.<br><br>I know Jerry will never desert me.<br><br>And neither will I, honey,<br>neither will I.<br><br>I'm going to stick to you until<br>you can walk.<br><br>You're so thoughtful, I just don't know<br>what to say to you.<br><br>Don't give it another thought,<br>I know just how you feel.<br><br>Let's have another drink.<br><br>That's beautiful.<br><br>You know, that music makes me<br>want to dance.<br><br>Doesn't it make you want to dance?<br><br>Even if a wanted to, I couldn't.<br><br>- I bet you were a beautiful dancer.<br>- Thanks.<br><br>I was pretty good.<br><br>I'd like to see you dance.<br><br>Just once.<br><br>Do you think maybe you could?<br><br>Just to please me.<br><br>Some other time maybe.<br><br>Oh, come on, there's nobody here<br>to see you except me.<br><br>Maybe if you had another drink,<br>you would?<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Good evening.<br><br>- Mr. Marvin will be right in.<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>- Where's Miss Drake?<br>- She's upstairs with Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Is everything all right?<br><br>Oh, yes, they're drinking<br>champagne together.<br><br>Champagne?<br><br>It's all right. Susan's getting Mrs. Marvin<br>drunk so she'll get up and walk.<br><br>So that's why you dragged me<br>out of the house.<br><br>- Good heavens, Susan can't drink.<br>- She's all right.<br><br>She took 20 grains of aspirin, that'll<br>counteract any alcoholic effect.<br><br>- I suppose that was your brilliant idea.<br>- No, it was Professor Hogarth.<br><br>There's Jerry.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Good evening.<br><br>- Where's Susan?<br>- She's upstairs with Babe.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Come on. Come on, it's easy.<br><br>Just a few steps to please me.<br><br>It's perfectly simple.<br><br>Come in.<br><br>You can do it if you want to.<br><br>- Susan!<br>- Shhh.<br><br>Come on, get up.<br><br>- You don't have to be coaxed.<br>- Susan!<br><br>She can walk, she can walk.<br><br>- Susan, what are you talking about?<br>- She wishes I could walk.<br><br>- We've been talking about it this evening.<br>- But you can walk.<br><br>She's had a little too much<br>champagne, I think.<br><br>You'd better come along<br>with me, darling.<br><br>Darling, that's the first time<br>you ever called me darling.<br><br>Oh, hey, I'm going to carry you<br>to your room.<br><br>- Carry me?<br>- Oh...<br><br>- You want to carry me in your arms?<br>- Uh-huh.<br><br>All my life I've had to stand<br>on my own two feet...<br><br>...and now you want to carry me<br>in your arms.<br><br>- Susan, what's happened?<br>- She's just had a little too much champagne.<br><br>- Hello, Dad.<br>- You're intoxicated.<br><br>No, I'm not, Dr. Hogarth said 20 grains of<br>aspirin would make me immune to stimulants.<br><br>She's drunk.<br><br>I want some champagne.<br><br>Something must have gone wrong.<br><br>Close the door and call the doctor.<br>Tell him to get here right away.<br><br>So I can walk, can I?<br><br>I'll fix her.<br><br>Will somebody turn out that light?<br><br>It's the setting sun, Susan.<br><br>- It's late afternoon.<br>- Of the following day.<br><br>- Afternoon?<br>- Uh-huh.<br><br>Well, what happened to last night<br>and this morning?<br><br>Please answer that phone.<br><br>Phone, what phone?<br><br>Phone, what phone, the phone<br>that's ringing.<br><br>- There's no phone ringing, Susan.<br>- Then turn off that burglar alarm.<br><br>- Let me die in peace.<br>- Now, darling.<br><br>And don't shout at me.<br><br>Nobody's shouting at you<br>and there's no bell going.<br><br>No bell going, I can hear it as clear as...<br><br>Well, as clear as a bell.<br><br>- It's all in your head.<br>- Ooh!<br><br>What head? I have no head.<br><br>It's just a knot up there to keep<br>my skin from unraveling.<br><br>Well, it was worth it.<br><br>I made her walk and Jerry<br>was there to see it.<br><br>But she didn't walk, Susan.<br><br>And I don't believe she can walk.<br><br>You've always been able<br>to think clearly, Susan.<br><br>Look at it through the eyes of others.<br><br>You're in an unenviable position.<br><br>You've been made love to by what<br>is legally still a married man.<br><br>Well, since it's I who am in the<br>unenviable position,<br><br>do you mind if I look at it through<br>my own eyes?<br><br>Susan.<br><br>I don't care what anybody else thinks.<br><br>I still think she's pretending.<br><br>And I'm not going to give up trying.<br><br>Jerry's going to take his wife<br>to Georgia Hot Springs.<br><br>What did you say?<br><br>Dr. Cassell's orders.<br><br>Says she seems to be too upset<br>here emotionally.<br><br>Must go away.<br><br>- What did Jerry say?<br>- What could he say?<br><br>What could any decent man say<br>under the circumstances?<br><br>Behold, oh fairest of women,<br>whither thy lover has gone.<br><br>I've just come back from the same<br>place, Jerry, it's ghastly.<br><br>- You sure were stinking last night.<br>- I'm so thoroughly ashamed.<br><br>There's no need to be ashamed,<br>I understood it perfectly.<br><br>Did you, Jerry?<br><br>Sure, I know the solaces brewed<br>into a bottle.<br><br>I'm the freat-grandfather of all<br>unquenchable thirsts.<br><br>How are you, granddaughter?<br><br>Did I... did I say anything unseemly<br>while I was... stinking?<br><br>You kept insisting that Babe could walk.<br><br>Did I?<br><br>When I'm swacked, everything<br>I want comes true too.<br><br>- I remember once when I...<br>- Let's fill it up.<br><br>There are a lot of things<br>I'd like to come true.<br><br>Fill it up? You plagiarized that<br>phrase from me.<br><br>I remember the day I coined it,<br>I was in Joe's barroom.<br><br>I held out my glass and I said,<br>"Fill it up, Joe, old boy."<br><br>The phrase caught on like wildfire, it was<br>translated into seven different languages.<br><br>Hey, hey, that's whiskey,<br>not champagne.<br><br>What's good enough for you<br>is good enough for me.<br><br>For richer or poorer, in sickness<br>or in health, sober or stinking.<br><br>Susan...<br><br>There's something I have to tell you.<br><br>You don't have to tell me, I know.<br><br>There's nothing else you can do.<br>When are you leaving?<br><br>Tomorrow morning.<br><br>Well, it's nice traveling by daylight.<br>You can see the scenery.<br><br>I've never seen the South.<br>You have, haven't you, Jerry?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Yes, Babe mentioned it once.<br><br>Well, it's been very pleasant, Mr. Marvin.<br>I'll be watching for you in the newsreels.<br><br>I'll nudge the fellow next to me<br>and I'll say, you see that man?<br><br>We met on a boat.<br><br>- Got to know each other rather well.<br>- Shut up, shut up, shut up.<br><br>We mustn't let our shipboard<br>acquaintance end like all the others.<br><br>Let's hear from each other<br>once in a while.<br><br>- I'll write every day.<br>- What will you say?<br><br>I'll say, Susan, dear...<br><br>Well, for the same postage stamp<br>you could make it a little stronger.<br><br>I'll say, Susan, darling...<br><br>Darling, darling, darling.<br><br>I'll only be gone a week.<br>A month at most.<br><br>Maybe a year. A lifetime.<br><br>- Oh, I was ringing for Hattie.<br>- She's gone into town to pack your things.<br><br>- I suppose you know we're leaving.<br>- Yes.<br><br>- Was there something you wanted?<br>- Would you get me a cigarette, please?<br><br>- Have one?<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Light, please.<br><br>You don't look well, Susan,<br>you shouldn't drink.<br><br>By the way, I forgot to thank you.<br><br>If it wasn't for you picking up<br>Jerry in Cristobal...<br><br>...and giving him a sense of decency,<br>a conscience,<br><br>he'd have walked out on me<br>accident or no accident.<br><br>While we're in the process<br>of letting our hair down,<br><br>why don't you admit that you can walk?<br><br>Oh, I couldn't do that.<br><br>You'd be taking an unfair<br>advantage of me.<br><br>You're so strong and intelligent.<br><br>You've got college degrees and<br>prize-winning scholarships.<br><br>I've only got my weekness.<br><br>I'm just a dumb helpless female<br>with no one to lean on...<br><br>...but my husband.<br><br>I've heard of women like you.<br><br>You marry a man and play a game.<br><br>Every word of yours, every look<br>must bring so much in return.<br><br>- What a dirty place you make this world.<br>- Oh, you've got the wrong slant, Susan.<br><br>This wedding ring is the emblem<br>of virtue, darling.<br><br>If you have it on your finger,<br>you're always in the right.<br><br>The other woman is... well.<br><br>She's the other woman.<br><br>In three months your divorce<br>will be final.<br><br>And you can pack that emblem<br>away in mothballs.<br><br>In three months I could spot you<br>two of them and still make it.<br><br>I week in Georgia Hot Springs<br>after a few mineral baths.<br><br>Some sunshine and away<br>from emotional stress.<br><br>With Jerry alongside of me.<br><br>I'll be able to hobble around a little.<br><br>And I can look very beautiful<br>hobbling around a little.<br><br>Naturally I'll tire very easily, but...<br><br>Jerry, he's so sweet.<br><br>He'll carry me up to my bed<br>to rest awhile.<br><br>And then...<br><br>But don't be impolite and leave now,<br>I'm not through.<br><br>I'm a civilized individual with a firm<br>stomach and a fair amount of manners.<br><br>But there are times when a good case<br>of seasickness is in order.<br><br>Oh, good heavens!<br><br>Operator! Operator!<br><br>I want to report a fire.<br>Yes, hurry, please.<br><br>The fire is at 1746 Riverdale Drive.<br>Come as quickly as you can.<br><br>Oh, there you...<br><br>- Quick, put this on.<br>- What's the idea?<br><br>The house is on fire, we've got<br>to get out of here.<br><br>- Oh, yeah, how did it start?<br>- In my laboratory.<br><br>In your laboratory.<br>Why didn't you put it out?<br><br>I tried to, it's too big a blaze.<br>For heaven's sake, put this on!<br><br>Why don't you call the fire department,<br>they're paid to ut out fires.<br><br>I have. We can't wait, you're going to<br>get out of here if I have to pull you out!<br><br>Go ahead. Drag an invalid out of bed.<br><br>I'd make a very pathetic picture<br>lying in a heap on the floor.<br><br>All right... if that's the way you feel.<br><br>Why should I quarrel with fate when<br>she gives me one more chance?<br><br>It won't work, Susan. First you put the call<br>buzzer over there away from the bed.<br><br>Then it's a few glasses of champagne<br>to cheer me up.<br><br>Now it's a fire.<br><br>I can't walk, Susan, didn't you know?<br><br>I've got shock. Two doctors said so.<br><br>I've heard of people bedridden for years<br>who in a situation like this...<br><br>...suddenly find they can not<br>only walk, but run.<br><br>Well, my shock is a special<br>kind of shock.<br><br>Only a miracle can cure it.<br><br>And that'll take place at<br>Georgia Hot Springs.<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Smoke. It usually accompanies fire.<br><br>A few wet rags smouldering in a pale<br>would make a lot of smoke.<br><br>These old houses are like tinder boxes.<br><br>Once they catch on fire,<br>there's no putting them out.<br><br>It can't be much of a fire,<br>or you wouldn't still be here.<br><br>Oh, I'm going to stay to see<br>that you don't trip going down the stairs.<br><br>- What's that out there?<br>- The house is on fire, it's burning.<br><br>It's getting warm, don't you think?<br><br>Rats usually desert a sinking ship.<br><br>It hasn't reached the staircase yet, you can<br>make it if you hurry, but you've got to hurry.<br><br>I'm a cripple, someone will have<br>to carry me.<br><br>There's nobody here, just you<br>and me and the fire.<br><br>How cozy.<br><br>That fire isn't going to wait until<br>you've had your mineral baths,<br><br>your sunshine and freedom from<br>mental stress.<br><br>You won't let me burn.<br><br>No. No, I won't let you burn.<br><br>Come on. You can make it<br>if you hurry.<br><br>Susan! Susan!<br><br>Jerry!<br><br>You're very kind. Thanks anyway.<br><br>Susan, Babe!<br>Darling, are you all right?<br><br>Jerry, thank heavens you're here.<br><br>Don't be frightened, we'll have you<br>out of here in a minute.<br><br>Oh, Jerry, my back...<br><br>- Go ahead, Susan!<br>- Oh, my coat! My ermine coat!<br><br>The house is burning around your ears<br>and you're worrying about a fur coat.<br><br>- Out the back way, Susan.<br>- I'm coming.<br><br>Oh, Jerry, your beautiful house.<br><br>It's all right, Susan.

papers<br>for your mom, hmm?<br><br>- Yeah, hey, Mr. Meredith.<br><br>- What you got there?<br><br>- Just something my mom needs.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>This old place, huh?<br><br>Time was, not a day<br>went by when someone<br><br>wasn't stopping by the<br>office to ask me about it.<br><br>- Yeah, I just have to research<br>that for a book report.<br><br>- Why didn't you just<br>ask your mom about it?<br><br>- She's been a little...<br><br>- Right, out of sorts.<br><br>I was sorry to hear about<br>the trouble at home.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I might have some<br>answers for you.<br><br>This house, it's been a god<br>damn tough sell for 50 years.<br><br>Never had much luck<br>with it myself.<br><br>But your mom nearly did once,<br><br>until the buyers found out.<br><br>- Found out what?<br><br>- To understand that,<br><br>you'd have to understand<br>who lived there.<br><br>- Who lived there?<br><br>- Miss Natty Nocks.<br><br>- Natty Nocks?<br><br>Like Natty Knocks nine times?<br><br>I thought that was just<br>an old ghost story.<br><br>- Why, where do you think<br>those stories come from?<br><br>There's always a<br>little truth to 'em.<br><br>Nocks family around here, hell,<br><br>go all the way<br>back to the 1800s.<br><br>Hard scrabble German folk.<br><br>And Natty Nocks, now,<br>she was the only child<br><br>of a God fearing<br>German farm couple.<br><br>One day, they<br>discovered her upstairs<br><br>in the family home<br>in bed with a boy<br><br>and those good Christian<br>church going parents of hers,<br><br>they tossed her<br>out on the street.<br><br>- That's harsh.<br><br>- Anyway, she took off for LA,<br><br>hopes of becoming a movie star.<br><br>And the funny thing is...<br><br>The funny thin is,<br>Wyatt, she almost was.<br><br>You see, Natty Nocks,<br>she starred in those<br>drive-in movies,<br><br>B pictures, double<br>bill horror flicks,<br><br>one right after the<br>other back in the 60s.<br><br>Yeah, she was pretty.<br><br>Not much of an actress.<br><br>And when her looks gave out,<br>well, the movies stopped.<br><br>She wound up back here<br>with a young child.<br><br>The old Nocks place had been<br>abandoned by her family.<br><br>They just kind of moved in.<br><br>No one around this town had<br>anything to do with her,<br><br>or the boy.<br><br>And desperate to make<br>ends meet, Natty...<br><br>Well, Natty became<br>a, how do I put this?<br><br>A good time for the men in town<br><br>who wanted to live<br>out their fantasies<br><br>of being with a movie star.<br><br>Of course, the wives in town<br><br>did not appreciate Ms. Natty's<br>local one woman brothel<br><br>or the little black<br>book that she kept<br><br>all their husband's names in.<br><br>Because of the kind of parts<br>she played down in Hollywood,<br><br>the women had somehow<br>convinced themselves<br><br>that she was some kind of<br>a hippie witch and a whore.<br><br>They tried to run<br>her out of town.<br><br>Oh, Natty was<br>having none of that.<br><br>No, sir.<br><br>She refused and just<br>kept her business busy,<br><br>busy, busy, busy,<br><br>busy writing down the names<br>of all those husbands.<br><br>And when she wouldn't tell 'em<br><br>where she hid her<br>little black book,<br><br>they lit a tool shed<br>behind her house on fire,<br><br>Natty locked inside.<br><br>A coroner called it<br>death by misadventure.<br><br>An accident, could have<br>happened to anybody.<br><br>Shouldn't store gasoline<br>in a toolshed, they said.<br><br>Blah, blah, blah.<br><br>But people know better.<br><br>I knew better.<br><br>A town knows its secrets, Wyatt.<br><br>A town knows how to hide 'em.<br><br>- What happened to the boy?<br><br>- Nate?<br><br>Nate was institutionalized.<br><br>They fried his brain<br>with shock therapy<br><br>to keep him quiet about<br>what he might know,<br><br>what he might have seen.<br><br>- Shock therapy?<br><br>- He died up in Butler<br>psych ward around 2008.<br><br>- Is he really dead?<br><br>- See for yourself, Wyatt.<br><br>They got him buried in a<br>cheap box up in Oak Hill.<br><br>- Who's there?<br><br>- Are you speeding.<br><br>- In this?<br><br>- What's going on?<br><br>- It's cops.<br><br>- Is this about the copper?<br><br>- Shut up<br><br>- Is something wrong, officer?<br><br>- Taillights busted and<br>your tags are expired.<br><br>License and<br>registration, please.<br><br>- Come on, really?<br><br>- Officer, this is<br>my fault, really.<br><br>- I got a flat tire on my<br>bike and I needed a ride home.<br><br>- And where are you<br>going this time of night?<br><br>- I was at my mom's<br>office in town.<br><br>I was picking something up for<br>her and it got late and dark<br><br>and I needed a ride.<br><br>We've been having a<br>real hard time at home<br><br>and Britt's been helping us out.<br><br>- You Diane Hemming's boy?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- I was up at your<br>house not long ago.<br><br>- Yeah, sorry about that.<br><br>- Look, I don't wanna see<br>this rig back on the road<br><br>until the tags are clean<br>and the lights are working.<br><br>You understand?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>Thank you, officer.<br><br>- Now y'all go straight home.<br><br>And you, young lady,<br>it's past your bedtime.<br><br>- Are you okay, Jolie?<br><br>- No, I'm not okay!<br><br>Wyatt's phone got turned<br>off and we needed money,<br><br>so we ditched.<br><br>Then we stole copper wire<br>from the Baldwin house.<br><br>Then they saw a man<br>beating up a girl.<br><br>She might be dead but<br>nobody can find her<br><br>because the cops<br>didn't do anything!<br><br>Dad's never coming home again.<br><br>- What?<br><br>Wyatt, what is<br>she talking about?<br><br>Is any of this true?<br><br>- All of it.<br><br>All of it's true.<br><br>- We are going home right now.<br><br>- I'm sorry.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>You can't be here.<br><br>- I belong here.<br><br>- Nobody belongs here,<br>not in her house.<br><br>Not in her house!<br><br>Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>Do I know you?<br><br>- You know who I am.<br><br>- No, you can't be Nate.<br><br>No, no, no.<br><br>You stay back, now.<br><br>You stay back.<br><br>You stay back, now!<br><br>- You didn't try to help her.<br><br>- Why are you hassling me?<br><br>I don't know shit<br>about no stolen copper.<br><br>- I got a report of a black<br>Toyota seen in the area.<br><br>You know who drives<br>a black Toyota?<br><br>You, tough guy.<br><br>- Me and a million<br>fucking other people.<br><br>Get out of here with that crap.<br><br>- I've got a witness who<br>says they saw a black Toyota<br><br>near the high school.<br><br>You wanna talk about that?<br><br>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Don't you lay that girl on me.<br><br>I got a cleanup job<br>over there, okay?<br><br>Do your fucking job<br>and check it out.<br><br>- You better believe I will.<br><br>- Am I done here?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>You'll be back.<br><br>- Hey Ken, I need you to<br>run a set of prints for me.<br><br>- I can't run<br>unauthorized prints.<br><br>You know that.<br><br>- Look, it's the last time.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Oh, third base line,<br>lower level, row 12.<br><br>Dodgers, Giants.<br><br>- Fine.<br><br>I can maybe have<br>these by tonight.<br><br>- I need it sooner.<br><br>- They catalog every search.<br><br>I have to be careful.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>You have my cell phone.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>- Hi, can you help me?<br><br>The front desk said that I<br>was supposed to go back here,<br><br>but I don't think I'm<br>in the right place.<br><br>- The right place for what?<br><br>- I have information<br>about a murder.<br><br>- A murder?<br><br>- The missing girl<br>from the television.<br><br>- Come with me, please.<br><br>This way.<br><br>Don't worry about the lights.<br><br>They're fixing the place up.<br><br>- Is this the right way?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Excuse me.<br><br>Are you Britt Chamberland?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Detective Squares.<br><br>The desk sergeant said you<br>might have some information.<br><br>- Oh, he was taking<br>me to see you.<br><br>- Okay, well, he's<br>taking you the wrong way.<br><br>Why don't she come with me?<br><br>I'll buy you a Coke and<br>you can tell me your story.<br><br>This way.<br><br>Brains before bears, Abner.<br><br>What the hell's<br>your problem, man?<br><br>So the game is<br>called Natty Knocks.<br><br>- That's right.<br><br>- I've got kids, but<br>refresh my memory.<br><br>- You run up to somebody's<br>door and you knock<br><br>and you run away<br>before they answer.<br><br>- Nine times.<br><br>But my friend didn't run away.<br><br>He looked through the window<br><br>and he saw this creepy<br>guy beating up a girl.<br><br>He thinks it's the same<br>girl on the missing posters.<br><br>Well, we got a big problem<br><br>with domestic violence.<br><br>I mean, is it possible he<br>saw a husband and wife thing<br><br>maybe get out of control?<br><br>- No.<br><br>No, he's sure that the man<br>was trying to kill her.<br><br>- And your friend called 9-1-1?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- So there's a record of the<br>call in the dispatch order.<br><br>- I suppose.<br><br>- And you say this<br>happened yesterday?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- So why don't you<br>think the officers<br><br>made an arrest at the scene?<br><br>I mean, what it sounds like,<br>she put a hell of a fight.<br><br>There would be broken furniture.<br><br>This guy would have<br>trauma on his face.<br><br>And yet this man didn't<br>leave in handcuffs.<br><br>- Yeah, that's why I'm here.<br><br>- But not your friend.<br><br>- Yeah, well, he's scared,<br><br>but he wants to do<br>the right thing.<br><br>Look, if there's a chance<br>that this girl can be found,<br><br>maybe she's still alive.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>- The only thing I<br>got from yesterday<br><br>is a call about some<br>stolen copper wire.<br><br>- Well, I'm...<br><br>I'm just...<br><br>I'm thinking about<br>the missing girl.<br><br>She's in my school.<br><br>- Well, listen, we're gonna<br>look into all of this.<br><br>In the meantime,<br><br>I just want you to stay<br>kind of close to home.<br><br>Be safe and I'll call<br>you if anything comes up.<br><br>And there's my number, so.<br><br>- Hi, Lori.<br><br>Is Mr. Meredith in?<br><br>- I haven't seen him yet today.<br><br>He did leave something<br>on your desk, though.<br><br>- Do you know what it is?<br><br>- I think it was something<br>about the old Nocks House.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>You might wanna talk<br>to Wyatt about this.<br><br>What are you up to, kid?<br><br>- Guys?<br><br>Guys?<br><br>- How'd it go?<br><br>- I talked to a detective<br>and I told him everything.<br><br>They're gonna be<br>all over that guy.<br><br>- What about the copper wire?<br><br>- I covered it up for you.<br><br>Don't do anything stupid<br>like that again, okay?<br><br>- Is it over?<br><br>- Yeah, everything's<br>gonna be just fine.<br><br>- Did that cop know who we are?<br><br>- No, I didn't<br>tell him your name.<br><br>I just said it was a friend.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Can you stop being such a<br>pain in my ass all the time now?<br><br>You know, I'm only<br>trying to help you.<br><br>- Yeah, I'm sorry.<br><br>- Accepted.<br><br>Now, your mom is<br>working late tonight<br><br>and I think we need<br>to have a little fun.<br><br>- I wanna go to the ghost<br>house and wear my mask<br><br>and reach into the guts<br>and pull out prizes!<br><br>- You coming?<br><br>- I should tell<br>Robby that it's over.<br><br>- He's the one that got<br>you into this trouble<br><br>in the first place.<br><br>You know that, right?<br><br>- I owe him.<br><br>- No, you don't owe<br>him a fucking thing!<br><br>- Uh, excuse me.<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>- I'm so sorry, you scared me.<br><br>- Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>I didn't mean to, I<br>thought you were a prowler.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>That time of year, huh?<br><br>- Yeah, every kid in town.<br><br>- No, I'm Diane with<br>Hemmings Realty.<br><br>I'm sure you've seen our signs.<br><br>- Of course.<br><br>- Well, we used to<br>have this listing<br><br>and then now the bank has it.<br><br>And I think there might<br>be someone squatting here,<br><br>so I wanted to just<br>go check it out.<br><br>- Well, I think I saw<br>the back door open.<br><br>Let's go take a look.<br><br>- Oh, okay.<br><br>Looks like somebody<br>tried to break in.<br><br>It was probably kids.<br><br>I have two of my own.<br><br>Should get rid of<br>all of this junk.<br><br>- That must mean<br>something to someone.<br><br>- Somebody without taste.<br><br>- Somebody may be<br>coming back for these.<br><br>- Doubtful.<br><br>Everybody thinks this<br>place is haunted.<br><br>- Do you believe in ghosts?<br><br>- Me, no.<br><br>No, I believe people<br>are bad enough.<br><br>They don't have to invent<br>things to be afraid of.<br><br>- Should we look<br>in the basement?<br><br>- No.<br><br>I think I'm good.<br><br>I've seen enough.<br><br>But thank you for your help.<br><br>If you are ever on the<br>market for a house...<br><br>- I know, I know.<br><br>A house is not a house<br>unless it's a Hemmings house.<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>- That's right.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- What is that?<br><br>- I don't know.<br><br>No idea.<br><br>- What the hell<br>is going on here?<br><br>- Say choke me.<br><br>- No.<br><br>- Say it!<br><br>- No!<br><br>- Louder!<br><br>- Choke me.<br><br>- Louder.<br><br>Louder!<br><br>- Choke me!<br><br>- Do as you're told.<br><br>- Robby, what the<br>hell is happening?<br><br>- I thought that if<br>I could get his name,<br><br>I could turn it into the<br>police and get the 5,000 bucks.<br><br>And me and my mom can get out<br>of this shitty town for good.<br><br>- What are you talking about?<br><br>- There's a reason why the<br>cops didn't do anything, Wyatt.<br><br>- What are you saying?<br><br>- He's a cop.<br><br>- What?<br><br>- Yeah, his name<br>is Abner Honeywell.<br><br>- How do you know that?<br><br>- I checked his driver's license<br><br>and I saw his fucking<br>uniform, dude.<br><br>- You went back there?<br><br>Are you insane?<br><br>- I had to!<br><br>- Tell me you didn't.<br><br>- I threw that through<br>the fucking window.<br><br>But I forgot you're a psycho<br><br>and put your initials<br>on everything!<br><br>- What were you thinking?<br><br>- I thought that maybe if<br>he knew we saw what he did,<br><br>he would get scared and then<br>turn himself into the police<br><br>and then I could<br>collect the money.<br><br>- Dude, Britt went to<br>the police station today<br><br>and she talked to a cop.<br><br>- What?<br><br>- Yeah, she told him<br>everything we saw.<br><br>- What did he look like?<br><br>What was his name?<br><br>- I don't fucking know, Robby.<br><br>- Money.<br><br>- Yeah, it's a<br>little late for that.<br><br>Dude, we have to find Britt.<br><br>- Remember the rules.<br><br>- Don't move and<br>don't touch anything.<br><br>- And don't scare<br>your babysitter.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>This is awesome, right Britt?<br><br>- If you say so.<br><br>- Did you just pee?<br><br>- No.<br><br>- I think I did.<br><br>- I told you not to<br>scare your babysitter.<br><br>- Abner, what the fuck<br>are you doing here?<br><br>- I'm working.<br><br>- Working.<br><br>Where's your duty belt?<br><br>- Have you been following me?<br><br>- I've been following<br>her and I'm glad I did.<br><br>You know, a pair of uni's<br>talked to you recently,<br><br>but you're good old Abner,<br>three weeks from retirement.<br><br>Everybody loves you.<br><br>Well, I never bought it.<br><br>I never bought you.<br><br>Right, don't pull

scared.<br><br>- It's okay, close your eyes.<br><br>I'm right across the hall.<br><br>- Britt.<br>- Yeah?<br><br>- Why are there bad people?<br><br>Why did God make bad people?<br><br>- No one really knows.<br><br>That's the truth.<br><br>Sometimes it's a traumatic<br>event that makes them bad<br><br>or just bad blood,<br>like they're born bad.<br><br>- But why?<br><br>Why does God make mistakes?<br><br>- I can't really tell you that.<br><br>But I do know that<br>all that matters<br><br>is that your mom loves<br>you and Wyatt loves you.<br><br>And I love you,<br>and even your dad.<br><br>Most people are good.<br><br>Can you say that?<br><br>- Most people are good.<br><br>- Right, now go to sleep.<br><br>We'll do something fun tomorrow.<br><br>- Britt.<br><br>-

it<br>won't be a problem.<br><br>- Let's go.<br><br>- They locked you in a nuthouse!<br><br>And then you started that fire<br>and killed all those people!<br><br>Abner Honeywell died, not you.<br><br>Where the fuck are you?<br><br>They dragged you out,<br><br>all burnt up and<br>covered in dirt.<br><br>You made them think you were<br>Abner, but it was just you,<br><br>just you little Nate Knox.<br><br>You waited.<br><br>You waited until<br>people stopped talking<br><br>or caring about some<br>creepy old story.<br><br>And then you came back home<br><br>as a new man named<br>Abner Honeywell.<br><br>You've been very busy.<br><br>This ends tonight, fucker!<br><br>Where are you?<br><br>- Wherever you want me to be.<br><br>Momma's boy.<br><br>- Please don't hurt me,

What does?<br><br>- Just... just try.<br><br>- Sorry, it's like...<br><br>- OK.<br><br>- What's wrong with the bagel?<br><br>- It's not the same.<br><br>- As what?<br><br>Damn it, Emmett.<br>Will you just--<br><br>Emmett.<br><br>Emmett, will you<br>tell me your problem?<br><br>- My problem is<br>I'm not sure what's real.<br><br>Emmett.<br><br>What's your problem?<br><br>- I'm Emmett<br>and my problem is,<br><br>is that my girlfriend<br>and I took mushrooms<br><br>and I seem to be<br>really upset right now<br><br>about something she did,<br><br>but I'm not going to<br>say what it is.<br><br>- What do you think she did?<br><br>- I think she was<br>playing a game.<br><br>I guess it's kind of like a game<br>of playing right now, but...<br><br>No, in that game, she...<br><br>pretended to be his mother?<br><br>Emm.<br><br>Emm.<br>- Your turn.<br><br>- OK.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>I'm Anya.<br><br>My problem is,<br>is that I I've been trying<br><br>to tell you something<br>for a while now<br><br>and I have been<br>too scared to do it.<br><br>I really wanted to<br>have your child.<br><br>My problem is that I can't.<br><br>- My name is Anya.<br><br>And I want to have a family<br>but I don't think I can.<br><br>- What do you mean?<br><br>What do you mean?<br>You don't think you can?<br><br>- Because all I care about<br>is writing poetry.<br><br>And going to gallery openings<br>and impressing my friends,<br><br>and basically maintaining<br>this image of myself<br><br>that is like the opposite<br>of holding a baby in my arms,<br><br>and being covered<br>in all that weird puke.<br><br>My mother is this<br>really cold intellectual type,<br><br>and I never really<br>got me love from her<br><br>unless I did<br>something exceptional.<br><br>And you see,<br>when I was like a kid,<br><br>I was like, really gifted.<br><br>And so I got a lot of love<br>from her because of that.<br><br>But now that<br>I'm not seen as like,<br><br>the most amazing poet or like,<br>even like adult, you know,<br><br>my mom seems to have, you know,<br><br>like, like,<br>disappeared from my life.<br><br>But I think it's like<br>in a meaningful way.<br><br>But also, she may think<br>that I'm just mediocre<br><br>and I'm, like,<br>kind of broken because of that.<br><br>And I'm just,<br>I'm just so worried<br><br>that I'm not capable<br>of giving the kind of love<br><br>that a child or maybe even<br>a husband would deserve,<br><br>because I can't<br>think of anything<br><br>beyond my own fucking neuroses.<br><br>Which is why<br>a couple of months ago,<br><br>I pulled out all my eyebrows<br><br>and I looked like<br>a fucking mannequin.<br><br>- Did you look at it?<br><br>There's no child in here.<br><br>They never could be<br>a baby in here<br><br>because I can't have a baby.<br><br>Why aren't you saying anything?<br>I can't have a baby!<br><br>- I mean, this is what<br>you said last night.<br><br>I need to<br>get out of these clothes.<br><br>- "If my body gave me<br>this need to have a child,<br><br>why can't it make me love him?"<br><br>- You think I wrote that?<br>- I don't know, did you?<br><br>- That would<br>actually be impossible<br><br>because I would never do that.<br><br>- But you did do that to me,<br>Anya.<br><br>- Oh, OK.<br>I'm gonna show you right now.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>No. Look, look, look.<br>Is it the same handwriting?<br><br>- Great, so you admitted<br>you're pretending.<br><br>- I don't think so.<br>No, I don't know.<br><br>- You don't think so<br>or you don't know?<br><br>- I just told you<br>I can't have a baby.<br><br>- How do I know you're<br>not fucking with me?<br><br>- About what?<br>No, of course not.<br><br>- You just said<br>you were pretending, Anya.<br><br>- Not about that.<br>- About fucking what?<br><br>About everything?<br><br>- I just told you<br>I can't have a baby.<br><br>What else do you<br>want me to tell you?<br><br>- You know what?<br>I want the fucking truth.<br><br>That's what I want.<br><br>I want the fucking truth.<br>That's what I fucking want.<br><br>- No, you're not going to do that.<br>- I swear to God.<br><br>I swear to God.<br>I swear to fucking God, Anya.<br><br>- I don't know.<br><br>- You made it up.<br>- I don't know.<br><br>I don't know.<br>- That's not a fucking answer.<br><br>It's not an answer, Anya.<br>- I don't know what I

traveled with a lot of care<br>and seriousness.<br><br>However, very bad things nearly happened<br>on a number of occasions.<br><br>In Guinea, there was a popular uprising<br>against the president.<br><br>[gunshots]<br><br>There's been gunfire all morning.<br><br>Every so often, you hear, "bam, bam, bam."<br><br>[gunshots continue]<br><br>[Peter] He was torn and conflicted.<br><br>He'd say, "I wonder, should I be doing<br>what all my friends are doing?"<br><br>"Getting married.<br>Some of them have children."<br><br>"What am I not doing<br>that I should be doing?"<br><br>"Am I right living my life the way I am?"<br><br>[animal cooing]<br><br>He asked me once<br><br>if I was disappointed in him.<br><br>Wandering around the world like this,<br><br>searching for something<br>that he couldn't put his finger on.<br><br>[insects chirping]<br><br>[Stephen] Been thinking about family,<br>my friends.<br><br>It is, without doubt, the lowest,<br><br>awfullest time of my life right now.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>until tomorrow.<br><br>[Peter] He was going to come home<br>and live the conventional life.<br><br>But before that,<br>he was going to make one last stop.<br><br>[ethereal music playing]<br><br>Stephen always loved the sea.<br><br>He loved scuba diving out in the ocean.<br><br>He heard that there was a town in Egypt<br>which is kind of a mecca for divers.<br><br>[Stephen] I recall going along the coast<br>and just listening to the sea.<br><br>I got a real feeling of hope<br>about this place.<br><br>[man] When Steve drive from Cairo by bus,<br><br>all the way to Dahab,<br><br>he just throw the bag in the room.<br><br>He just, "Where's the bar?<br>Let's go have a drink."<br><br>Next day, he go diving.<br><br>He become a friend.<br><br>We see each other every day.<br><br>He loved the Bedouin culture.<br>He learned Arabic.<br><br>We become like family.<br><br>[Peter] He stayed down there,<br>making a living instructing scuba diving.<br><br>[children shouting]<br><br>So I arrived here<br>to do my Divemaster course,<br><br>and that was Steve.<br><br>He was my instructor.<br><br>Before long, we were hanging out daily.<br><br>And going out dancing.<br><br>[Mahmoud] Dahab, for Steve, a second home.<br><br>[Peter] He had a little house of his own.<br>He just loved it.<br><br>'Cause he told me at one stage,<br><br>"I've discovered this new thing<br>called free diving,<br><br>and it's the business."<br><br>[Kristof] Steve asked me to join him<br>on a free dive session.<br><br>[ethereal music playing]<br><br>The first time I dived down,<br>holding my breath,<br><br>all the problems and the shit<br>from daily life just vanished.<br><br>It doesn't exist down there.<br>It's beautiful.<br><br>Steve just fell in love with free diving.<br><br>And especially the Blue Hole.<br><br>You literally walk<br>from the beach into an abyss.<br><br>Like, there is this gaping hole<br>in the coral reef,<br><br>which really, like,<br>wants you to go down there.<br><br>And then there's this arch,<br>like a chapel underwater.<br><br>Unfortunately, it also has a...<br>a bad reputation.<br><br>It took lives.<br><br>[man] This is the most dangerous dive site<br>on Earth.<br><br>It's thought to have claimed<br>over 100 lives.<br><br>[man] In terms of fatalities,<br><br>the Blue Hole is even more perilous<br>than Mount Everest.<br><br>As well as myself,<br><br>there's only a handful of people<br>who have free dived through it.<br><br>Natalia Molchanova was<br>the only woman to do it.<br><br>[in Russian] Diving the Arch has left<br>a lasting impression on me.<br><br>[man, in English] This is the dive<br>that unlocked something within herself.<br><br>A fearlessness<br>that she didn't know was there.<br><br>It made her<br>the best free diver in the world.<br><br>With the Arch,<br>you've got to know if you're ready for it.<br><br>It's a really deceiving place to dive.<br><br>You have to find the exit.<br><br>If you aren't able<br>to see it clearly for any reason,<br><br>you're basically on your own.<br><br>If something does go wrong,<br>there's no way to come up.<br><br>There's 30 meters of rock over your head.<br><br>[woman] Outside the Blue Hole,<br><br>there are the memory stones<br>remembering the people who died there.<br><br>My boyfriend died in... in the Blue Hole,<br><br>just when I moved to Egypt.<br><br>It is dangerous because it is deep.<br><br>It is always the ocean.<br><br>And we are nothing.<br><br>[man] So you've said that your objective<br><br>is to become the second woman<br>in the world, after Natalia Molchanova,<br><br>to conquer all the absolute world records.<br><br>So how long do you think<br>this is gonna take you?<br><br>[cheering and applause]<br><br>[Alessia, in English] I don't know.<br>[laughs] Of course, it's a dream.<br><br>Really, a dream for every athlete,<br>I think.<br><br>But it's really difficult.<br><br>[man, in English]<br>Natalia Molchanova, champion of the deep,<br><br>holding over 40 free diving records,<br><br>some of them incredible,<br>death-defying feats.<br><br>[in English]<br>Today, my dive was 101 meters.<br><br>[man] That's 101 meters down and up.<br><br>More than two Statues of Liberty,<br><br>stacked ground to torch.<br><br>[woman] Natalia was the first<br>female free diver to reach 101 meters<br><br>in competition.<br><br>And she held that number<br>for a very long time.<br><br>So 101 was the magical number<br>Alessia was trying to beat.<br><br>[in Italian] I want to improve<br>by a few meters.<br><br>In fact, I hope to go<br>well beyond 90 meters,<br><br>to then touch the three-digit number<br>in a couple of years.<br><br>[in English] Everybody must have a dream<br>and put all their effort in.<br><br>And really, everything is possible.<br><br>[host] Can you describe the feeling<br>of diving at those... those kind of depths?<br><br>Talk about the feeling on the body<br>of the pressure.<br><br>[Alessia, in English]<br>The deeper I'm diving,<br><br>the pressure compresses<br>the air in my lungs,<br><br>until my lungs are the size of my fist.<br><br>[heartbeat]<br><br>After 30 meters,<br>the pressure pushes me down.<br><br>[heartbeat slowing]<br><br>It's called the free fall.<br><br>And this is, for me, the best part.<br><br>It feels like you are flying.<br><br>The silence, it's unique.<br><br>It's like being<br>in the last quiet place on the Earth.<br><br>[heartbeat deepening and slowing]<br><br>[Adam] There's a surrender element to it.<br><br>It's like a high.<br><br>But getting sucked to the bottom<br>of the sea can be scary,<br><br>even for free divers.<br><br>You have to break this deep meditation.<br><br>'Cause coming back to the surface,<br>that's when the work really starts.<br><br>You've gotta swim the length<br>of a 70-storey skyscraper.<br><br>Swimming against all that pressure,<br>it's like swimming against the current.<br><br>By then,<br>your oxygen supply's already dwindled.<br><br>You're kicking hard<br>so your heart rate's increasing,<br><br>burning that oxygen quicker.<br><br>[urgent music playing]<br><br>You're getting to the point<br><br>where you don't have enough oxygen<br>to keep the systems going.<br><br>That's when you can have a blackout.<br><br>[William] The brain<br>basically just turns itself off.<br><br>It doesn't mean that your brain is dying.<br><br>But it's kind of like a safety mechanism.<br><br>The brain preserves itself<br>by shutting off all its functions.<br><br>And from that moment,<br>you still have one or two minutes<br><br>before brain damage would start to occur.<br><br>[man] Right, one more.<br><br>[blowing]<br><br>[pensive music playing]<br><br>[William] If you don't have<br>the right kind of medical attention,<br><br>it can go downhill pretty quick.<br><br>It's definitely not something<br>to be taken lightly.<br><br>[Kristof] For years, Steve<br>and I were always trying to dive deeper.<br><br>It became like a game between us.<br>I was going for the Belgian record.<br><br>He was chasing the Irish one,<br>which was 61 meters.<br><br>When you start competing,<br>you wanna push yourself.<br><br>[pensive music continues]<br><br>[Stephen chokes]<br><br>[Kristof] He had a few blackouts<br>in the beginning.<br><br>He likes to bang his head on the wall.<br>You know, really, like, "Let's do this!"<br><br>And, like, "I can't,<br>but I'm gonna do it anyway."<br><br>- [Kristof] How deep?<br>- Sixty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Shite.<br><br>[panting]<br><br>[Kristof] But Steve never gives up.<br><br>[inspirational music playing]<br><br>- Yeah!<br>- [cheering]<br><br>And it made him very proud<br>to be the best Irish.<br><br>[Peter] The other attraction<br>of free diving<br><br>was that it was a boundary.<br><br>A boundary to be pushed.<br><br>Free diving is an extreme sport.<br><br>And extreme sports<br>have extreme consequences.<br><br>[gasping]<br><br>Stephen?<br><br>[Kristof] Steve had a really,<br>really strong blackout.<br><br>The safety team just didn't know<br>what to do with him.<br><br>- [man] Stephen...<br>- [Stephen wails]<br><br>[Kristof] He almost died there.<br><br>[man] Release... release him.<br><br>We should go back.<br><br>[Kristof] He didn't want<br>anyone else going through that.<br><br>So he started to be interested<br>in being a safety diver.<br><br>Steve had the best background for the job<br><br>because the only other person<br>that can do a safety for a free diver<br><br>is a free diver.<br><br>As a scuba diver,<br>you can't be a safety for a free diver<br><br>because they go up slowly to decompress.<br><br>So if something happens,<br>you have to react fast.<br><br>[Stephen] 99% of all free diving incidents<br>happen within the last ten meters.<br><br>If there is an issue, we close the airways<br>so they can't swallow water,<br><br>and we take them to the surface.<br><br>[woman] Please get out of the way<br>for the safety.<br><br>[Kristof] He worked very hard<br>to make a name for himself.<br><br>No. I'm doing it myself. So, uh...<br><br>[Kristof] After a while,<br>Steve got the chance<br><br>to be on the safety team in Kalamata,<br><br>which was his first<br>international big competition.<br><br>[man] That's all good. Put it down.<br><br>[Adam] Natalia's son, Alexey Molchanov,<br><br>was the men's world record holder<br>at the time.<br><br>He was going for the deepest dive ever.<br><br>And his mom is watching.<br><br>[tense music playing]<br><br>Safety, keep your distances.<br><br>Eighty.<br><br>[Kristof] Steve was the first safety.<br><br>That means he has to dive the deepest.<br><br>[tense music continues]<br><br>[Adam] Stephen kicked down to 30 meters.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>[Kristof] You have to know,<br>as a safety diver,<br><br>you take in a mouthful of air,<br>you go down,<br><br>and if everything goes right,<br>you just swim up together.<br><br>You're never there<br>for longer than a minute.<br><br>But Steve was already waiting<br>at 30 meters for quite some time,<br><br>- so he's running out of air.<br>- [beeping]<br><br>Come on, Alexey.<br><br>3'30, it's a very long dive time.<br><br>Andrea, you go down as well.<br><br>[tense music continues]<br><br>- Trouble.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>[woman] Trouble?<br><br>[Kristof] Steve started<br>to have contractions.<br><br>He's seconds away from the blackout.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>But then he saw Alexey get into trouble<br>around 40 meters.<br><br>Split-second decisions.<br><br>Save Alexey or save himself.<br><br>[man speaking Russian]<br><br>[Alexey groaning]<br><br>[Stephen, in English]<br>Breathe, Alexey. Breathe.<br><br>- [man] Breathe, Alex.<br>- [Stephen] Breathe for me.<br><br>[Alexey coughs]<br><br>- [Stephen] Breathe.<br>- Breathe, mate. You're good.<br><br>[oxygen hissing]<br><br>[Alexey, in English]<br>I had severe lung damage.<br><br>My mama told me that Steve saved me.<br><br>I am very grateful for his...<br>this selfless act.<br><br>[laughing] And that was, like,<br>my first meet with Stephen, this accident.<br><br>[somber music playing]<br><br>[Kristof] From that moment on,<br>he was really the star of the competition.<br><br>Everybody knew him.<br><br>Stephen Keenan. [laughing]<br><br>Who saved the world champion.<br><br>One of the things about that story<br>was how amazing the safety diver was.<br><br>At that time, it was the deepest<br>blackout safety dive in competition.<br><br>I consider that an act of heroism.<br><br>To save Natalia's son,<br><br>Stephen took his job as a safety diver<br>so seriously that he put himself at risk.<br><br>[woman] Right.<br><br>[in Italian] We're on<br>day three of training.<br><br>I'm really pleased, because<br>I've already beaten my personal best.<br><br>I've done 88 meters.<br><br>- [speaking Italian]<br>- [laughing]<br><br>[Francesca, in English] Alessia was<br>inching closer and closer<br><br>to that magical number, 101 meters.<br><br>But she wasn't the only one.<br><br>[man] Excellent dive.<br><br>[Francesca] Hanako Hirose of Japan<br>was a strong challenger.<br><br>[in Japanese] Can I have a message<br>regarding the competition?<br><br>This time,<br>I'm going to get the world record.<br><br>[man] Thank you.<br><br>[Adam, in English] Hanako has<br>an innate connection to the sea.<br><br>It's something she was just born to do.<br><br>[Hanako, in Japanese] When I dive,<br><br>I often imagine myself swimming...<br><br>like a whale or dolphin.<br><br>[Francesca, in English] Hanako was going<br>deeper and deeper and deeper.<br><br>And Alessia had to respond.<br><br>[in Italian] Alessia Zecchini<br>was extraordinary.<br><br>Her dive was extremely elegant<br>in every respect.<br><br>[William, in English] We had this amazing<br>rivalry between Hanako and Alessia.<br><br>Hanako very consistently<br>moved through the depths.<br><br>[Francesca] Alessia would<br>come back at her.<br><br>[William] Eighty-nine meters.<br><br>[Francesca] Ninety.<br><br>- [cheering]<br>- [William] Ninety-two.<br><br>[Francesca] Ninety-three.<br><br>[woman] Tell us how deep your dive was.<br><br>[in English] Ninety-four meters.<br><br>- [squeals and laughs]<br>- [man chuckling]<br><br>- [in Italian] How many meters?<br>- Ninety-four.<br><br>Wow. With Zecchini, we're not gonna stop.<br><br>- [cork pops]<br>- [cheering]<br><br>[William] There had been this dominance<br>by Natalia Molchanova for so many years.<br><br>And then suddenly,<br>these women were so close.<br><br>But when you push close to a limit,<br>trying to set world records,<br><br>there's a lot that can go wrong.<br><br>She is considered to be<br>one of the greatest athletes ever<br><br>in what is one of the world's<br>deadliest extreme sports.<br><br>Free diving.<br><br>Natalia Molchanova went for a dive<br>on Sunday, and she simply vanished.<br><br>[Francesca] Natalia Molchanova<br>disappeared off the coast of Spain.<br><br>They didn't recover her body.<br><br>[man] Molchanova's son, Alexey,<br>a record-breaking free diver himself,<br><br>told the New York Times,<br><br>"It seems she'll stay in the sea.<br>I think she would like that."<br><br>[somber music playing]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>It was all too surreal.<br><br>I was shocked.<br><br>It was really sad<br>because she was so strong.<br><br>[woman, in English]<br>We lost Natalia Molchanova.<br><br>And in recognition<br>of her great accomplishments,<br><br>please join me<br>for a one-minute breath-hold.<br><br>[Adam] It shocked the free diving world.<br><br>They realized that they're more at risk<br>than they thought.<br><br>Because if it can happen to Natalia,<br>the greatest ever,<br><br>it can happen to anybody at any time.<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>After Natalia's accident,<br><br>I began to realize<br>that it could be dangerous.<br><br>I was going deeper and deeper.<br><br>It's black. It's dark.<br>You feel locked inside.<br><br>You can see things that don't exist.<br><br>I was too scared.<br><br>I wanted to turn around and go back.<br><br>[oxygen hissing]<br><br>I didn't feel safe.<br><br>[hopeful music playing]<br><br>[Peter, in English]<br>Stephen had an idea<br><br>that he could use<br>his own experience as a safety diver<br><br>to open this center for free diving.<br><br>[cheerful music playing]<br><br>Stephen and his friends saved some money.<br><br>They built a premises<br>on the seafront in Dahab.<br><br>Here, uh... in front of my free diving shop.<br><br>This is where I'm working.<br><br>[Peter] He was very proud to tell me<br><br>he was finally making a success<br>of his business,<br><br>following his dream.<br><br>[Kristof] I was so proud of him.<br><br>He finally had this purpose.<br><br>Hey, Steve. Hi!<br><br>[Stephen] Hello, hello!<br><br>It's a nice, chilled evening<br>in Dahab free divers.<br><br>When I first met him,<br>I was super intimidated.<br><br>He had this massive reputation<br>as the best safety diver.<br><br>I heard about the famous rescue<br>he did for Alexey. [laughs]<br><br>I was looking for a place<br>to teach free diving.<br><br>They asked if I wanted to join the team.<br>I said, "Yes, sure."<br><br>I was in charge of social media.<br><br>And Steve's not the type<br>to put himself in the limelight.<br><br>But for me, it was obvious.<br><br>"Steve, come on! Like,<br>you're super famous in the community."<br><br>"You have to start promoting yourself."<br><br>Because Stephen knew all the free divers,<br><br>they were able to invite<br>all these big names,<br><br>like Alexey Molchanov, to give workshops.<br><br>And this attracted a lot of free divers.<br><br>The school became super famous.<br><br>[man] For you, what is success in life?<br><br>I suppose success is fulfilling<br>your aspirations, goals, dreams.<br><br>I'm currently living in Egypt,<br>where I run a free diving center.<br><br>I guess I'm happy in that respect.<br>I like what I do.<br><br>Other parts of my life<br>are not so successful, I guess.<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm a 38-year-old man,<br>and I don't have any kids.<br><br>I suppose that's, people say,<br>something that I haven't quite fulfilled.<br><br>[wistful music playing]<br><br>He had some relationships in Dahab,<br>but, uh,<br><br>nothing that lasted.<br><br>He would've liked to, like, fall in love<br><br>and have a long-term relationship<br>and kids.<br><br>Part of him was missing that side.<br><br>He needed to meet a super special person.<br><br>[man] Thank you so much<br>for taking the time to talk to me,<br><br>and for all the listeners of the show too.<br><br>[Alessia, in English]<br>Thank you. It's a major pleasure.<br><br>[man] Do you think<br>you push too hard sometimes<br><br>in search of records?<br><br>I guess that's, uh,<br>maybe more typical of younger athletes.<br><br>[Alessia] Yeah, maybe, sure.<br><br>[Enzo, in Italian] We had no idea<br>she was after the world record.<br><br>She doesn't like to worry us,<br>so she wouldn't tell us.<br><br>[man, in English] What would you like<br>to accomplish in the next few months?<br><br>[Alessia] I would like to go deeper.<br><br>I would like to do the world record.<br><br>[laughs] That's my goal.<br><br>[man] When is your next competition?<br><br>[Alessia] Vertical Blue.<br><br>[dramatic music playing]<br><br>[Francesca] Welcome to Vertical Blue<br>in the Bahamas.<br><br>We have 42 competitors<br>from all around the globe<br><br>who are announcing<br>ten different national records.<br><br>[Francesca] Vertical Blue is like<br>the Wimbledon of free diving.<br><br>It's gonna be a beautiful day.<br>Lot of great dives going on today.<br><br>[Francesca] Only the best<br>of the best are invited.<br><br>Alessia Zecchini, and I'm from Italy.<br><br>[Francesca] Within the competition,<br><br>there is an exceptional team<br>of medics and safeties.<br><br>Stephen, want to introduce<br>the safety team?<br><br>I wanna make sure there's a good dynamic<br>between the safety team and athletes.<br><br>That's vitally important to me.<br><br>Stephen was working<br>as a chief of safety in Vertical Blue.<br><br>Being responsible<br>for the overall safety of this,<br><br>like, one of the biggest<br>free diving events in the world.<br><br>There will be two safeties always<br>to meet you, a deep and shallow.<br><br>The deep will meet you<br><br>between anywhere from 20 to 40 meters,<br>depending on the dive.<br><br>[William] We take safety very seriously<br>at Vertical Blue.<br><br>One of the only incidents,<br><br>fatal incidents<br>that's happened in competition,<br><br>was a death here of an American athlete,<br>Nick Mevoli.<br><br>[Nick] Never take a dive for granted.<br><br>You don't know what...<br><br>you don't know what dive<br>is gonna be your last.<br><br>[Francesca] Nick had a long history<br>of pushing a little bit too hard.<br><br>And things catastrophically went wrong.<br><br>Nick had a lung squeeze.<br><br>[William] With the lung squeeze,<br><br>the blood vessels<br>inside your lungs can burst<br><br>and leak blood into your air spaces.<br><br>[Francesca] We're talking about<br>tissue that is torn<br><br>and then scarred.<br><br>If you are consistently injuring yourself,<br>it's cumulative.<br><br>[William] And ultimately, that led<br>to Nick getting a very bad squeeze.<br><br>And we... we couldn't save him.<br><br>[Stephen] Of course, we have our medics<br>who will be giving a pep talk as well.<br><br>Okay, I'll keep this pretty quick.<br><br>If we think someone might be in danger,<br>we have the authority<br><br>to tell a diver<br>that they cannot dive any longer.<br><br>I always say to them,<br>"I want you to go home."<br><br>"To be able to get on that plane<br>and go home to your family."<br><br>And secondly, I don't ever want them to be<br><br>that diver that's on oxygen<br>at the age of 40<br><br>because they've messed up their lungs<br>so terribly.<br><br>[pensive music playing]<br><br>[William] In competition,<br>we have to retrieve a tag<br><br>attached to the bottom plate<br>at target depth as a proof.<br><br>[Francesca] She's reaching for her tag.<br><br>[William] A white card<br>is a 100% valid performance.<br><br>- [man] Yeah!<br>- Yes!<br><br>[Alexey] As soon as somebody helps you,<br>or you lose control,<br><br>even on the surface,<br>that's disqualification.<br><br>It's a red card.<br><br>[William] Over two weeks of competition,<br>the athletes get six attempts each.<br><br>[Alexey] It's very simple.<br><br>The deepest dive wins.<br><br>...is coming to meet you.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>[Alessia, in English]<br>I want to do so much. Yeah.<br><br>A world record, that's the main point.<br>So, I mean, it's super important for me.<br><br>[Francesca] It was clear<br>that Alessia was after the world record.<br><br>So she was going to push her limits.<br><br>Unfortunately,<br>Alessia had a problem with the dark.<br><br>And Vertical Blue is unique<br>in that it's this collapsed cave.<br><br>It's like going into space.<br><br>[slow heartbeat]<br><br>[Francesca] She's on her way back.<br><br>We've got Stephen Keenan,<br>who's our deep primary safety,<br><br>and he's going to meet her.<br><br>[tense music playing]<br><br>[man, in Italian] Well done, Alessia.<br><br>- [woman] Breathe.<br>- [man] Breathe.<br><br>- Breathe, breathe, breathe.<br>- [woman] Breathe. Breathe.<br><br>[Alessia groans]<br>- [team] Breathe, breathe.<br><br>- [in English] I'm okay.<br>- [man speaking Italian]<br><br>[in English] I'm okay.<br><br>[Francesca] The judges are conferring.<br><br>I'm sorry, Alessia, red card.<br><br>[man 1, in Italian] Breathe.<br><br>[man 2, in English] Grab her. Keep her up.<br><br>[Francesca] Support her. Just support her.<br><br>[man 2] Just support her head.<br><br>[man speaking Italian]<br><br>- [man 1, in Italian] Breathe.<br>- [in English] Somebody hold her.<br><br>Hold her for me. Up.<br><br>Up. You okay?<br><br>Come on.

Chill out.<br><br>[Francesca, in English]<br>There were hecklers<br><br>who said she didn't look like<br>she could muscle up these depths.<br><br>The Internet trolls were robust<br>in their criticism.<br><br>[in Italian] Hello.

Okay?<br><br>[Leigh] Stephen was so good at knowing<br>the ones that could be in danger.<br><br>He studied them,<br>and he knew their weaknesses.<br><br>He would say,<br>"We gotta watch out for this one."<br><br>And he was dead-on every time.<br><br>Kind of freakishly so.<br><br>With Alessia, it was driving Stephen<br>absolutely crazy,<br><br>because he was seeing all of these<br>little things that she was doing wrong,<br><br>and that it was probably<br>contributing to her blackouts.<br><br>And so he started training with Alessia<br>during the competition break.<br><br>[peaceful music playing]<br><br>[in Italian] Breathe.<br><br>Breathe.<br><br>[man speaks Italian]<br><br>- [in English] Are you okay?<br>- I am okay.<br><br>[man] Yes!<br><br>[laughing]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>He inspired trust straight away.<br><br>I saw in him<br>the only one who could coach me.<br><br>[calm, uplifting music playing]<br><br>[man speaking Italian]<br><br>[in English] Are you okay?<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian] The thing<br>that struck me most was his eyes.<br><br>They were blue, so blue, like the sea.<br><br>His gaze was enough.<br><br>Before diving,<br>we would look at each other.<br><br>And this gave me strength.<br><br>Feeling his presence<br>made you feel safe in the darkness.<br><br>[woman, in English]<br>We see a special relationship<br><br>between the safety diver and the athlete.<br><br>For example, Alessia asks about you<br>in every deep dive she does.<br><br>It's massively important, because, um...<br>free diving is a very psychological sport.<br><br>Okay? There's many little facets<br>that can affect a dive.<br><br>And if somebody, when diving,<br>wants to feel secure,<br><br>they're very happy if they're diving<br>with someone they're familiar with,<br><br>and they know that<br>the safety diver is familiar with them.<br><br>How they dive.

Dear Jesus!"<br><br>And she shows up<br>with a ham sandwich and a can of Coke.<br><br>I was like,<br>"Oh my God. Okay, I love her already."<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>Okay, Alessia. On your feet.<br><br>[man] I knew<br>she'd just set a world record.<br><br>She matched the world record<br>one day in training.<br><br>It was inspiring<br><br>to see someone do these depths<br>that I'd kinda only dreamed of doing.<br><br>And you could tell, like...<br><br>Like, even Steve, he'd be like,<br>"Ah, she makes it look too easy."<br><br>You know? But it was...<br>That was, like, that was her. [laughs]<br><br>[Lily] Alessia and Steve<br>were together all the time.<br><br>He was coaching her<br>and preparing her for the Arch,<br><br>sitting down every evening<br>after her training for weeks,<br><br>going through everything,<br>telling her what she should do next.<br><br>It's another evening in Dahab free divers.<br><br>[Lily] Then they were together<br>every evening.<br><br>[Stephen] Say hello.<br><br>Hello!<br><br>Say hello, guys.<br><br>[all] Hey.<br><br>[Lily] It was an amazing summer.<br><br>They had a very special connection.<br><br>It was just a really good match. [laughs]<br><br>Simon! Belated happy birthday, bud.<br>Hope you had a great one.<br><br>Sorry it's only me to say happy birthday.<br><br>Or actually, no,<br>there's somebody else. Wait.<br><br>Happy birthday!<br><br>[Stephen laughs]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>He adored being in the desert.<br><br>The happiness we shared was amazing.<br><br>[Lily, in English] We thought, "Okay,<br>this could be something pretty special."<br><br>We are gonna win the world championships.<br><br>We are gonna make world records.<br><br>And this amazing lady<br><br>is going to win the world championships.<br><br>True that.<br><br>[Homar, in Italian] We were all together<br>that evening. It was our last night.<br><br>And I remember<br>he turned to Alessia and said,<br><br>"You'll be the first woman<br>to do the Arch after Natalia Molchanova."<br><br>We told Stephen,<br><br>"Look after Alessia."<br><br>And obviously, as a safety, he told me...<br><br>"Leave it with me."<br><br>[bells clanking]<br><br>[in Italian] We're discussing the dive<br>before getting in the water.<br><br>This is my coach, Steve,<br>and these are some other athletes.<br><br>We'll get in the water soon.<br><br>I'm preparing all the gear.<br><br>We're ready to get in the water.<br><br>[Kristina, in English] Steve asked me<br>to take photos of this dive.<br><br>I took pictures<br>doing briefing for all safety divers.<br><br>Steve really went through each detail.<br><br>Everybody knew<br>exactly what they were supposed to do.<br><br>[Lily] The plan was Alessia would dive<br>52 meters, pulling herself on the rope,<br><br>and then, entering the Arch,<br>swim horizontally for 30 meters.<br><br>As she arrived<br>on the other side of the Arch,<br><br>the safety line should be there<br>in the middle.<br><br>Steve would be there<br>at the end of the line waiting for her.<br><br>Natalia crossed the Arch with a monofin.<br><br>[Nathan] What Alessia prepared for<br>was a dive without the monofin,<br><br>which is the hardest way you can do it.<br><br>[Lily] Maybe she wanted to do it that way<br><br>to be better<br>than the best free diver ever.<br><br>[rhythmic beeping]<br><br>Everything was timed.<br><br>They had made practice runs<br><br>to know how long exactly it takes<br>her to go down to 52 meters,<br><br>how long it takes for her<br>to swim horizontally for 30 meters.<br><br>And we had a countdown,<br><br>so we would make sure that Steve<br>would be already there before she arrived.<br><br>[beeping continues]<br><br>[Kristina] I go down<br>with the other two technical divers<br><br>with a camera to do the filming.<br><br>[Nathan] After she goes down,<br>my job was to hold the rope,<br><br>wait until we felt her hit the bottom,<br><br>go down a few meters, look.<br><br>If she wasn't coming back up,<br>come up and we're done.<br><br>After she swam through the Arch,<br><br>she was relying on finding the rope<br>on the other side to pull herself back up.<br><br>[man] Five, four, three, two, one, zero.<br><br>[Nathan] We watched Alessia go down.<br><br>I'm feeling the rope,<br>so I can tell when she reaches the bottom.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[faint, slow heartbeat]<br><br>[Nathan] After we felt her let go<br>of the rope, we'd give an okay sign<br><br>to tell the other safety divers<br>that she entered the Arch.<br><br>That should've triggered Steve to go down.<br><br>[Lily] Ten seconds.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Lily] I started to give<br>the countdown to Steve.<br><br>[Lily] Five, four, three.<br><br>He asked me for ten more seconds.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>I just didn't really understand why,<br>because, um...<br><br>so far, everything had been going<br>according to plan.<br><br>So maybe the heart was going<br>a bit too fast for his liking,<br><br>so he wanted to take a few more seconds<br>to be really ready.<br><br>I really don't know,<br>because you can't discuss with him,<br><br>because he's preparing for his dive,<br>so he's not gonna talk.<br><br>It took him a little bit extra<br>to give me the signal.<br><br>[steady heartbeat]<br><br>[somber music playing]<br><br>[heartbeat slowing]<br><br>[Kristina] Alessia is coming out<br>of the Arch, but Steve is not there.<br><br>She doesn't see the rope.<br><br>She is swimming the wrong direction.<br><br>She didn't realize<br>that she was already out.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Lily] I have, uh, one hand on the rope.<br><br>I'm waiting for the feel of the pull<br>to say that they're starting to come up.<br><br>The pull is not coming.<br><br>I start to worry.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>Maybe she was swimming<br>a little bit slower.<br><br>Let's wait a little bit longer.<br><br>[Nathan] They should've been coming up<br><br>by the time<br>we swam across to the other side.<br><br>I knew at that point something was wrong.<br><br>[Lily] Now it's too long.<br><br>Something is not right.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Kristina] Alessia needs<br>to go up immediately.<br><br>She didn't know<br>that she's in completely the wrong place.<br><br>In one moment,<br>Steve left the rope super quickly.<br><br>[very fast heartbeat]<br><br>As a scuba diver, I cannot do shit.<br><br>I was very far.<br><br>I was just screaming.<br><br>[Lily] I could see<br>all the way to the end of the line.<br><br>There was no one.<br><br>[fast heartbeat continues]<br><br>[Nathan] We just can't see them.<br><br>Think fast.<br>Maybe the water current took them.<br><br>We would need to search<br>a much bigger area.<br><br>Thirty meters away, there was loads<br>and loads of tourists snorkeling.<br><br>[man laughing]<br><br>[inhales]<br><br>We're looking for someone amongst a mess<br>of people that can't properly swim.<br><br>[Lily] Everywhere I look,<br>they're not there.<br><br>I decided to come up and see<br>if I could see them on the surface.<br><br>[speaks French]<br><br>[Lily] There was no explanation.<br><br>[Kristina] I was swimming<br>as fast as I could.<br><br>I need to see if they are alive.<br><br>- [high-pitched ringing]<br>- [Alessia gasping]<br><br>[sounds fade]<br><br>[sighs]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian] The first meters,<br>everything seemed normal.<br><br>Until I reached the Arch.<br><br>I remember while I was swimming,<br>I felt it was a bit strenuous.<br><br>There was a problem.<br><br>Steve wasn't there,<br>but neither was the rope.<br><br>I just tried to follow the reef,<br><br>trying to see where the rope was.<br><br>But I realized I couldn't find it.<br><br>I'd made a mistake.<br><br>I suddenly saw Steve in front of me.<br><br>I remember he took my hands.<br><br>And he swam, bringing me to the surface.<br><br>- [high-pitched ringing]<br>- [Alessia gasping]<br><br>I don't remember<br>the first seconds when I surfaced.<br><br>I only remember, after a while,<br><br>looking around<br>and not understanding a thing.<br><br>[Kristina, in English]<br>Steve's face was in the water.<br><br>And I started screaming on her,<br>like, "Turn him face up!"<br><br>But I didn't realize<br>that she had blacked out.<br><br>And when I started screaming,<br>because I really screamed a lot,<br><br>she basically woke up,<br>and she started acting immediately.<br><br>Um...<br><br>[in Italian] Maybe I could have done more.<br><br>If I had been more conscious,<br>I don't know.<br><br>[Nathan, in English] If you are<br>on your own, and you start blacking out,<br><br>you have to be on your back.<br><br>If you're not on your back, you're done.<br><br>Steve probably took<br>his last seconds of consciousness<br><br>to make sure she was in a position<br>that she'd survive in<br><br>at the expense of ending up face down.<br><br>[poignant music playing]<br><br>[in Italian] The worst thing is<br>we couldn't do anything.<br><br>We couldn't save him.<br><br>He rescued me, but I couldn't rescue him.<br><br>[mournful music playing]<br><br>He was a hero,<br>and he showed it till the end.<br><br>[Kristina, in English]<br>You can see in the last photo,<br><br>he lost his life to save hers.<br><br>I was diving the lighthouse.<br><br>Like, actually, over there.<br><br>I finish my dive, I...<br><br>I look at my phone,<br><br>even, like, with my suit on, like, I...<br><br>My phone, I look at my phone,<br>like, "What?"<br><br>Like, there are 50 missed calls.<br><br>And I received a phone call.<br><br>Something happened to Steve.<br><br>And...<br><br>It...

Isn't that true?<br><br>Even if I wanted to, Romeo, I'm cursed.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Why don't you ask your brother?<br><br>He's in your father's workshop<br>with Connie.<br><br>He's very good with cars.<br><br>My brother,<br>does he even know anything about cars?<br><br>- What is he doing at my dad's workshop?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Connie was teaching him.<br>Oh, but he left it for music.<br><br>He says he's going to be more famous<br>than my dear friend...<br><br>That's bull, man!<br>He should be looking for a job.<br><br>That workshop belongs to my old man.<br>Who gave him permission?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Well, Godfather,<br><br>I'm off.<br><br>And thanks.<br><br>Does your dad live in his truck or what?<br><br>Sorta. Since Valentín died,<br>he hasn't turned it on.<br><br>But he tries every day.<br><br>He just sits and suffers in there all day.<br><br>Don't even think about<br>making fun of my car.<br><br>But didn't you tell me<br>it was brand new, Mom?<br><br>It was brand new some years ago.<br><br>Reach in through the window.<br><br>It doesn't even open! Fucking junk.<br><br>You take care of my precious!<br><br>I love...<br><br>WHEN I MET YOU I FELL AND GOT UP<br><br>What's up, loser?

Hey, are you racing in that?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Oh yeah?<br><br>I mean, it's incredible, but yeah,<br>I've tried it out and it runs very fast.<br><br>- Yeah?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Very fast, Grandma.<br>- Great.<br><br>Hey, so is this really where...<br>...Preciado works?<br><br>Yeah, sometimes,<br>but he never stays too long.<br><br>No, that kid's obsessed with his band now.<br><br>Oh, so now he wants to be famous<br>like my father?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- No way. That's impossible.<br><br>He better get to work, start hustling,<br>earning his bread and butter,<br><br>like we say in the capital.<br>His band is terrible, right?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Well, I'm leaving, Grandma.<br>I have a destiny to fulfill. I really do.<br><br>It's good to see you.<br><br>It's good to see you too.<br>Just don't disappear for so long,<br><br>because remember,<br>that's why you have this.<br><br>Eat your flan.<br><br>What? Are you serious?<br><br>My boy, you have to get another car.<br><br>Ha, maybe go talk to your godfather.<br><br>He has a truck, a bit small,<br>but with a big engine, son.<br><br>Fucking godfather.<br>He won't help me, Grandma.<br><br>I went, and he says that...<br>Says he's cursed and stuff.<br><br>He's such a coward.<br><br>Let me think about what I can do<br>to improve this piece of crap.<br><br>But, ooh, it's gonna be tough.<br><br>Listen up, everyone.<br>We got new furry friends...<br><br>BABY, FORGIVE ME<br>WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND?<br><br>20 DAYS UNTIL THE RALLY<br><br>Fucking Tino!<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>What?

Romeo Abitia?<br><br>- Yeah, it is.<br>- Sir, I'm calling from Bancomex.<br><br>We've been trying to contact you<br>due to the loan you requested,<br><br>which you've not paid for months,<br>accumulating quite a sum in interest.<br><br>Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been traveling.<br>I was on vacation,<br><br>but I'm gonna pay, huh?<br>Yeah, I'm going to pay.<br><br>Yes, sir. I must notify you<br>that your refusal to pay<br><br>has raised an alert that requires<br>immediate legal action from our...<br><br>What? I said I'm gonna pay, man, okay?<br>I'm gonna pay. These fuckers.<br><br>Romeo, what's with all the yelling?<br><br>Nothing. No.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>What's the story between Don Tasio<br>and my old man? Was there a problem?<br><br>Ah.<br><br>Well,<br><br>a long time ago, Tasio<br><br>was chasing after the prettiest<br>little girl in all Bahía Colorada.<br><br>But she was in love with Valentín.<br><br>Who was it?<br><br>It was me!<br><br>- Don't be stupid!<br>- Oh yeah.<br><br>Out of jealousy, Tasio wanted to buy<br>your dad's workshop.<br><br>There was no amount of money<br>in the world to convince Valentín.<br><br>A STORMY DESTINY<br><br>A GAME WITHOUT RULES<br><br>FORBIDDEN MEMORIES<br><br>A MARTYR'S HILL<br><br>Goddamn it.<br>I was already having a bad day.<br><br>Oh, just relax, Don Tasio. Calm down, man.<br><br>Listen, lately I've been<br>talking to my mom a lot about you.<br><br>About what or... or why?<br><br>Well, just some stuff, you know?<br>Some things, but...<br><br>Uh, basically that, uh,<br><br>you always wanted<br>my... my late father's workshop.<br><br>And what makes you think that I'm<br>still interested in that lousy workshop?<br><br>Let me tell you.<br><br>(A) Because that business is one of the few<br>in Bahía Colorada that isn't yours yet.<br><br>Right?<br><br>(B) Imagine it now, sir. Right now.<br><br>Someone is crossing Sinaloa on a plane,<br>in a Boeing 375.<br><br>It's all clear. They look out the window...<br><br>"Look!"<br><br>"That kingdom... is owned by a guy..."<br><br>"THIS YEAR WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST<br>FOR BAHÍA'S ECONOMY"<br><br>"...a fine landlord whose name is<br>Anastasio Candelario."<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>Listen to me.<br><br>Cut the bullshit.<br><br>Doesn't it belong to your grandma?<br><br>- No, it was my old man's.<br>- And you don't care about the inheritance?<br><br>No, of course I care about...<br><br>When I finish the race,<br>all I want is to leave.<br><br>I don't want anything<br>to do with Bahía Colorada, okay?<br><br>Your little speeches<br>are starting to contradict one another.<br><br>I'm very sorry, young man.<br><br>You're competing against Marén.<br><br>And what if you win the rally<br><br>and I'm just sitting here,<br>closing deals with you?<br><br>How do you think she'll feel?<br><br>Maybe I can make a deal with you<br><br>if you don't race the rally.<br><br>No. Come on, sir. Of course not.<br><br>That's different.<br>I can't accept that offer.<br><br>I... I came to do justice<br>to the memory of my old man.<br><br>Not even your mother would buy that story!<br><br>I know that you're broke now.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I can smell it all over you.<br><br>Stop that, Don Tasio.<br><br>Workshop or rally. It's your choice.<br><br>Okay, let me run the race,<br>and I'll lose on purpose. That a deal?<br><br>Okay. Deal.<br><br>First, take your grandma<br>out of the workshop<br><br>and when she's out, I'll give you half.<br><br>And after you lose the race,<br>I'll give you the rest. Agree?<br><br>Sounds good to me.<br><br>Your least favorite guy is here,<br><br>but you'll hate me even more<br>when you know why I'm here.<br><br>- What's up, Grandma?<br>- Hi, son.<br><br>Come on, spit it out.<br><br>I...<br><br>Well, I, uh...<br><br>I'm gonna... I'm gonna need the workshop.<br><br>I might be wrong, but as far as I know,<br>it's mine by inheritance, hmm?<br><br>As far as you know?<br><br>It's yours, and that's it!<br><br>This workshop belongs to him,<br>and the boy sold it to me, okay?<br><br>So it's mine.<br><br>That's my dad's fork-spoon, asshole!<br><br>Why do you have it, bastard?<br>What the fuck?<br><br>What are you doing with his hat,<br>bastard? Who do you think you are?<br><br>Why do you wanna be<br>like my dad, bitch? What the fuck?<br><br>The Don Cruz candle? You have no right<br>to have these things, asshole!<br><br>Well, your mom left me everything, uh...<br><br>Since you didn't take anything<br>when you left...<br><br>Well, I'm here now, and I own this place,<br>okay, and everything in it. Got it?<br><br>We'll give you a week<br>for you to gather all your shit<br><br>and tie up your loose ends.<br><br>My boy, this doesn't belong to you.<br><br>Your grandfather was<br>the one who built it on his own.<br><br>It wasn't Valentín.<br><br>Come on, son.<br>Your brother and I live in this workshop.<br><br>If you want to take it from me,<br><br>you'll have to bring the will,<br>which obviously doesn't exist.<br><br>Let's not get lawyers involved.<br><br>Don't make me laugh, Constanza.<br><br>You don't have enough money<br>for a legal battle.<br><br>Spare us the drama.<br><br>Don Tasio,<br><br>if I love anything in this life,<br>it's a good drama.<br><br>Get the hell out of here, huh!<br><br>Because this is my church,<br><br>and you are not a believer.<br>Get the fuck out of here!<br><br>You have one week.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>I'm not scared, you know. I'm not scared!<br>I'm not scared at all.<br><br>No fear of death, for once.<br><br>Grandma, I'm gonna enter the rally.<br><br>- Are you serious?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You're gonna be my wingman.<br><br>Let's screw over<br>that fucking Don Tasio and Romeo.<br><br>Look, I'm gonna make history<br>with my band. Yes, sir.<br><br>But also with the rally.<br><br>For me, for you, and my old man.<br><br>Everyone watch out for Preciado.<br>Hmm, I'll show them all.<br><br>I don't know much about races and names,<br>but, you know, I'm the new guy.<br><br>They'll all know my name.<br><br>There's only a few days<br>left until the big rally,<br><br>and people are already getting fired up...<br><br>I LISTEN TO ROMANTIC PROBLEMS<br>FOR $5<br><br>15 DAYS UNTIL THE RALLY<br><br>Good evening,<br>Bahía Colorada!<br><br>Prepared for you with love,<br>it's a pleasure for us to be here.<br><br>Now, we are Lágrimas Norteñas!<br><br>No fear of death, friends.<br><br>Can't hear ya!<br><br>Sing up!<br><br>Can't hear ya!<br><br>Not having talent<br>kinda runs in the family, right?<br><br>That dude<br>ain't my family, dude.<br><br>At least this dude filled<br>your fucking little restaurant<br><br>without having to pay anyone, you know?<br><br>Not like you,<br>always having to buy followers.<br><br>You're funny, Romeo.<br><br>And also, you're lousy<br>in front of the camera, hmm?<br><br>Well, yeah? Well, you? You've never even<br>stood in front of a camera.<br><br>Don Valentín says we've got<br>a bootleg copy here.<br><br>You're an idiot.<br><br>We're just warming up.<br>No worries.<br><br>- And Romeo?<br>- Yeah?<br><br>Hope God blesses you a talent<br>so you stop yearning for everyone around.<br><br>- Ay!<br>- Sure, man.<br><br>Just play the song.<br><br>Ladies and gents,<br><br>"Pionero de caricias."<br><br>That's shit, man<br><br>But you don't give yourself<br>the chance to know me, girl.<br><br>(A) I'm wild but sweet.<br><br>(B) Vulnerable, yeah,<br><br>but lethal.<br><br>You're unfuckable, boy.<br><br>But I would really like to see<br>your stupid face on telenovela.<br><br>I think it'll suit you.<br><br>Carlota Marén Candelario<br>Ruíz Apocampo Góngora y Corcuera.<br><br>The starry night is just starting.<br><br>And this scoundrel is ready<br>to steal a kiss from you,<br><br>no matter how much it costs.<br><br>How about that?<br><br>So, what now?<br><br>What will you do,<br><br>Alberto Romeo?<br><br>No, no, no, I'm not Alberto.<br><br>My name is Alfa.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah, Alfa Romeo.

Come on!<br><br>Anyways...<br><br>I choose the path of sin,<br>you know, and passion.<br><br>Tell me that I'm your boss girl,<br>Alfa Romeo.<br><br>No fucking way.<br><br>Big news!<br>Because the people asked for it,<br><br>Alcoholics Anonymous has come to town...<br><br>Let's congratulate Margarita, Juan,<br><br>Pedro, and Pancho.<br>They are getting better at last!<br><br>I don't even know why I did it. That dude...<br>Trust me, he's the last thing that I want.<br><br>He's a loser, a good-for-nothing,<br><br>and if that's not enough,<br>he doesn't have any style.<br><br>I've got enough shit going on, huh.<br><br>And on top of that, I have to put up with<br>this little egocentric girl like that?<br><br>You know, I'm a Nathy Peluso,<br>a Natti Natasha, a Karol G, a Becky G,<br><br>a big hot bitch, you hear?<br><br>No, I don't believe in love<br>or any shit like that.<br><br>(From now on, I believe in,<br>a) strip clubs, b)...<br><br>I will twerk to the floor.<br>Insecurities are out the door.<br><br>(C) José José. Obviously,<br>"El triste" and "Gavilán o paloma."<br><br>Although he made me laugh a little,<br>though I have no fuckin' idea why!<br><br>Well, he's actually kinda cute.<br><br>Well, she's actually funny.<br><br>She's funny, you know? She really is.<br><br>And I was kinda sad because...<br><br>Dude, what's the matter with Preciado?<br><br>Why do people love him so much?<br><br>Why? Tell me!<br><br>I've lived here 15 years.<br>Fifteen! So what's good?<br><br>You're very expressive, huh?<br><br>It says that I listen, not that I answer.<br><br>I LISTEN TO ROMANTIC PROBLEMS<br>FOR $5<br><br>What the fuck is up with Preciado?<br><br>That dude's singing is totally awful!<br><br>Lazy asshole! He should<br>go and find another job.<br><br>I know! He should go back<br>to fixing cars, huh? He's good at that.<br><br>- He's very good at fixing cars.<br>- Yeah. He fixed my car, and it works fine.<br><br>Not even using that totune<br>that kids use now, he won't make it.<br><br>- "Totune"? Autotune, idiot!<br>- Same thing.<br><br>Not even that, dude.<br>He shouldn't sing, dude.<br><br>He's a kick in the balls.<br><br>No, I... I felt like<br>my ear was bleeding...<br><br>You're not scared of driving, are you?<br><br>No!<br><br>- I don't think so, at least.<br>- What's the worst that could happen?<br><br>- Us crashing!<br>- Yeah, but there's nothing here!<br><br>Oh, come on!<br><br>I'm so fuckin' worthless.<br><br>The only thing I have<br>in this world is you.<br><br>And I love you!<br>I don't want you to ever leave.<br><br>But you're, like, 200 years old, Grandma.<br><br>And my only other family is a fucking<br>idiotic motherfucker who, honestly,<br><br>will never accept me,<br>no matter what I say.<br><br>What will people remember me for?<br><br>For a band that was all shitty?<br><br>Or some fucking tuned-up Chevy? Nah!<br><br>I don't like to talk about this,<br>my boy, but...<br><br>...your grandpa moved on<br><br>while he was fixing his Rambler.<br><br>He was always here working.<br><br>He tinkered with his cars<br>more than he did me.<br><br>And, well, I finished fixing the car<br>because that's what he would have wanted.<br><br>But after that,<br>I felt this fucking resentment<br><br>towards that damn car.<br><br>My only wish was to sink it in the sea,<br>right to the bottom!<br><br>But when I was driving<br>on the highway, listen,<br><br>the more I sped up,<br>the more fired up I felt,<br><br>and the more pissed off I was.<br>And the more I sped up...<br><br>No, my dear boy. Hold on.<br><br>Let me tell you.<br><br>I always thought<br>that fishing was my thing.<br><br>I was the women's champion<br>four years in a row.<br><br>It was all I cared about.<br><br>But after having lived that experience<br>of driving so reckless,<br><br>I understood your grandfather<br>and his devotion to cars,<br><br>and I followed his passion.<br><br>This garage. You know what I'm saying.<br><br>If you don't want to race in the rally,<br>my boy, don't try it.<br><br>Because if you're nervous,<br>you'll crash and kill yourself.<br><br>Now, look how beautiful this is.<br><br>FIRST PLACE<br>FISHING TOURNAMENT<br><br>How did you manage<br>to carry those?<br><br>Just imagine<br>that I'm carrying you and your brother.<br><br>The fish burrito business<br>sounded good. Oh, look! He's here.<br><br>Let me introduce you, Mr. Valeriano.<br><br>The most badass badass in all of Mazatlán.<br><br>I only need you to sign these documents.<br><br>The magic<br><br>will be done by my attorney, Valeriano.<br><br>That shitty workshop will become<br>the most impressive gift shop<br><br>in all of Bahía Colorada.<br><br>Dad, you really need another one?<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>Open something else, like<br><br>a beauty parlor?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Just to put on fake nails<br><br>and do some male waxing?<br><br>Oh, don't try it.<br>I'm not insecure like you.<br><br>I'm not the one<br>that has a child they called Princess<br><br>because of your pretty, green eyes<br>and who knows...<br><br>Hey, that's enough!<br><br>Stop with that.<br><br>Didn't anyone teach you manners<br>or what, huh?<br><br>You left me lying there like an idiot.<br>I thought I loved you, Marén.<br><br>It might not have been good for you,<br>but it was good for me.<br><br>Fucking men!<br><br>You don't even love your mothers, hmm?<br>And as for driving, forget it!<br><br>Oh, so you're just gonna<br>leave me again? Okay, sure.<br><br>No! Piece of shit!<br>This always happens to me.<br><br>I killed your precious one, Mom.<br><br>No, no, don't say anything.<br>I'm gonna fix it, okay? I'll fix it.<br><br>Just leave it there!<br><br>Tell Bebé I'll have it ready in two days.<br><br>Oh, that's great. By the way,<br>in the morning I towed the precious one.<br><br>The precious one? And who exactly is that?<br><br>Don Tasio, I'm pulling out.<br><br>My family sucks, sure,<br>but they're my family, huh.<br><br>So you won't get in the way of that.<br><br>One way or another,<br>I'm gonna beat your whole family down.<br><br>Listen to me, you little brat.<br><br>I've still got your signature<br>on these documents here,<br><br>so there's no way out of this.<br><br>Yeah. We'll see.<br><br>I've been waiting all day to cut my cake.<br><br>Where's your boss and his lawyers?<br><br>Chillax, dude. I come in peace.<br><br>I came to...<br><br>I came to tell you that I canceled<br>the contract with Don Tasio.<br><br>I was wrong.<br><br>I know.<br><br>And I could use your help, Grandma.<br><br>- Hmm?<br>- Oh yeah?<br><br>Oh my God. You have no shame, man.<br><br>I wouldn't ask if there was<br>another good workshop anywhere close,<br><br>but there isn't.<br>You offered it to me, right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Huh? Told you.<br><br>Do you think that you can come here<br>and say and do whatever you want,<br><br>then play innocent<br>and everything will just be fine?<br><br>Well, no.<br><br>Not while I'm around.<br><br>Connie, remember the car?<br>Well, Cosme has it.<br><br>No, but I need them to get it<br>so I can fix it.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Okay. Here's my idea, huh?<br><br>Your grandfather's Rambler<br><br>that your father<br>and your uncle Cosme used in the rally,<br><br>that car still exists.<br><br>And it's the most powerful<br>piece of engineering in all of Mexico.<br><br>I promise you.<br><br>I'll tell you where it is,<br>and you can use it for the race, Romeo.<br><br>But you two have to pick it up.<br><br>It's a deal?<br><br>Sure, sure. Yeah, good idea. Why not?<br><br>Here's why.<br><br>He'll stab me in the back.<br><br>No, he should go alone. Why me?<br><br>In exchange,<br><br>we require you to sing in our band.<br><br>No, no!<br><br>That won't happen. No way.<br><br>I'd rather ask Don Tasio for help,<br><br>getting down on my knees in a pink thong<br>in front of all of fucking Bahía Colorada,<br><br>with Tino braiding my hair<br>down in my fucking asshole<br><br>before playing in your band.<br>How about that?<br><br>- Oh yeah?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well... well, I'd prefer to have<br>Donald Trump tattooed on my tits<br><br>and then getting my balls run over<br>by a tractor on national television,<br><br>and have Belinda making fun of me,<br>smashing a fucking apple to her forehead.<br><br>All that before<br>having you joining my band.<br><br>- You're crazy.<br>- How's that, bro?<br><br>I... I mean, just...<br><br>Who told you<br>that this fucking asshole could even sing?<br><br>Romeo.<br><br>Oh, Romeo.<br><br>Preciado.<br><br>My cousin.<br><br>Comrade.<br><br>You're looking for a car,<br>or else there's no rally.<br><br>And you... You're looking for a singer,<br><br>or there is no band.<br><br>How about we try to give<br>just as much as we receive?<br><br>And we all win. Sounds pretty good.<br><br>I'm telling you now<br>that I don't know the songs.<br><br>I don't know anything about<br>what we're going to sing...<br><br>Don't play dumb.<br>You know the songs Dad used to play.<br><br>I forgot. It's been a long time.<br>You know that.<br><br>Fuckin' piece of shit!<br><br>- See? Is this what you wanted?<br>- Just give him a chance.<br><br>Look, buddy. Play nice, okay?<br><br>I saw you singing<br>"El triste" on the sidewalk.<br><br>Who are you trying to fool?<br><br>Go ahead. Do it.<br><br>Stop that!<br><br>What the fuck is this, dude?<br><br>It sounds like fucking ass, dude.<br>Fucking music's awful. Fuck off!<br><br>This isn't what I sing or listen to.<br>I listen to Chopin,<br><br>Mozart, other fucking singers.<br><br>What do you know, anyway, huh?<br>My dad never loved you.<br><br>Oh-ho! That's a low blow,<br>even for you.<br><br>It's okay, man.<br><br>- That's why we do this, to feel.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>- "El irreparable" is a great song.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>Don't be afraid.<br><br>Come on. We all know that singing<br>made things move in there. It was obvious.<br><br>What do you know?<br>Fuck away from me.<br><br>Hey, Romeon!<br><br>See you tomorrow at 6:00, okay?<br>It's a date!<br><br>Get the fuck out of here, man!<br><br>10 DAYS UNTIL THE RALLY<br><br>I waited 45 minutes. I was about to leave.<br><br>What's all this? What's with the backpack?<br><br>Where are we going?<br><br>Well, I'm bringing a jacket.<br>It might be cold.<br><br>- Let's go.<br>- Cold?<br><br>Don't be stupid, dude.<br><br>- Thanks, Francisco.<br>- Of course. No problem.<br><br>A map, seriously?<br><br>Grandma made it.<br><br>Use the Internet.<br>Don't you have service out here?<br><br>I don't think<br>there's much 5G here.<br><br>It's that way.<br><br>The sun is nice, huh?<br><br>Yeah, right.<br><br>Holy fuck, man!<br><br>I think we're lost.<br><br>Come on, let's go!<br><br>Come on! Come on!<br><br>Are you tired already?<br><br>No way, man. Winning.<br><br>Romeo!<br><br>Goddamn it!

Yeah.<br><br>From my dad, I think I got...<br><br>...being a fucking loser, you know?<br><br>Yeah, I got that gene.<br><br>We're destined for failure, right?<br><br>So it seems. Whatever.<br><br>Well, let's finish the rally.<br>It's not too late.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Already here. Come on.<br><br>- Even if it's just for pride. Right, man?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well, it turns out<br><br>they weren't so destined for failure<br>in the end.<br><br>I mean, they did finish last, right?<br><br>But Preciado made his name<br>with his talent for tuning cars,<br><br>and the workshop became a business.<br><br>The band was offered<br>a record deal with a label.<br><br>By a good record label?<br>No way! It was shitty.<br><br>But with that, they paid off Romeo's debt.<br><br>And guess who ended up<br>joining the band Lágrimas Norteñas?<br><br>NORTHERN TEARS<br><br>Whoo!<br><br>Well, the next song is<br>an original.<br><br>It's called "Mujer, eres letal."<br><br>And we are Lágrimas Norteñas!</div>

That's it!<br><br>I didn't skip a step!<br><br>The only reason none of us do it<br>is 'cause our cars sit too low<br><br>and we're too fat to fit<br>underneath that son of a bitch.<br><br>But you should know<br>how to change your oil.<br><br>You don't have to do it. You<br>need to know how it gets done.<br><br>If for no other reason than eventually<br><br>you're gonna have a child.<br><br>That child's probably gonna come<br>with you to Jiffy Lube.<br><br>And they're gonna be like,<br>"What are they doing in there?"<br><br>And you're gonna need to have<br>a better answer than,<br><br>"They're fucking<br>costing me 38 dollars."<br><br>It astounds me what men my age<br>don't know how to do anymore.<br><br>Basic household man shit<br><br>has started to fall through the cracks,<br><br>and it's fucking embarrassing.<br><br>There is an app now called Takl, T-A-K-L.<br><br>And it's basically Uber for being a man.<br><br>You can have a man come over<br>to your house<br><br>and do man shit while your man<br>gets online<br><br>and downloads Imagine Dragons LPs.<br><br>You can have Takl come over,<br>clean your house<br><br>and mow your yard.<br>That shit I get.<br><br>Those are menial tasks,<br>and if you have the finances<br><br>to pay someone else to do it for you,<br><br>God bless you.<br><br>But you can also use Takl<br>to have a man come over<br><br>and hang a television on your wall.<br><br>And that's when I'm like,<br>"No, bro."<br><br>You man up and you fucking hang<br>a television.<br><br>It takes 20 minutes,<br>and you get to use a drill!<br><br>How are you not using a drill<br>whenever you can?<br><br>They are the best!<br>They are half-gun, half-penis!<br><br>They are the shit!<br><br>They are a handheld dick<br>that will burst through walls.<br><br>They are battery-operated Viagra.<br><br>Just...<br><br>I carry one around<br>during sporting events.<br><br>"Let's go!"<br>"Come on!"<br><br>You get to use a stud finder.<br><br>You get to make dumbass stud<br>finder jokes for 20 minutes.<br><br>"Babe, babe, babe.<br><br>Put it on me, see if it works.<br><br>I think the batteries are dead.<br>Let me see it.

Now it's your turn.<br><br>Man up, drill some goddamn holes.<br><br>"Yeah, but Chris,<br>what if I fuck it up?"<br><br>Well, then you fucking learn to spackle!<br><br>"Chris, my dad never taught me<br>how to do that shit."<br><br>Well, that sucks, but get on YouTube<br><br>and let YouTube be your dad.<br><br>There are a thousand videos on YouTube<br><br>where real men will show you<br>how to do real man shit.<br><br>There is even an entire channel of videos<br><br>where an incredibly attractive woman<br><br>will show you how to do real man shit.<br><br>Yeah. Yeah, you can learn<br>while you jerk it.<br><br>And it feels good.<br>It feels... it feels better<br><br>because you learned something.<br><br>It's less shame.<br><br>Not no shame, less.<br><br>I call it "lurking it," and...<br><br>I love doing shit like that<br>around the house.<br><br>I just feel like a man.<br>It makes me so confidant.<br><br>If I hang a TV,<br>somebody's getting fucked.<br><br>I'm just like, "Yeah! Look<br>at that TV just hanging there!<br><br>Was it hanging there before?<br>No, it was not.<br><br>Why is it hanging there now?<br>This motherfucker.<br><br>You're goddamn right.<br>Yeah, we're gonna fuck<br><br>and then we're gonna watch Frasier.<br><br>Let's do this."<br><br>Last time I hung a TV on my wall,<br><br>I got so confidant after it happened,<br><br>I looked basic logic<br>in the face and said,<br><br>"You're not welcome here."<br><br>I hung a TV, I took a step back,<br><br>I was admiring my work,<br><br>I had my "I did shit" boner going...<br><br>Then it came time to do<br>the minute adjustments.<br><br>Tilt it, make it perfect,<br>so when I lay in my bed,<br><br>it's right in my face.<br><br>But when I approached the mount,<br><br>I realized Amazon had sent me a mount<br><br>that only tilts up.<br><br>Fucking idiots.<br><br>Why do they even make those?<br><br>Why did that not come up in the reviews?<br><br>"Think it through, think it...<br>Fuck, I hung it upside down!<br><br>Son of a bitch!<br><br>Get the drill!<br><br>Get the drill!"<br><br>Ladies, I don't mean to exclude<br>you over the next few minutes.<br><br>I do need to speak<br>to the gentlemen directly.<br><br>But I promise it's to benefit<br>y'all in the long run.<br><br>Gentlemen, over the last year or so,<br><br>what I refer to as "the man brand"<br><br>has taken a bit of a hit.<br><br>There have been a lot of<br>douchebags in positions of power<br><br>that over the last decades,<br>have been using that power<br><br>to treat women incorrectly.<br><br>And now they've started<br>to receive their comeuppance,<br><br>as well they should.<br><br>But now it's on us, as the common man,<br><br>to start to rebuild the man brand<br><br>by being men again.<br><br>By building shit, fixing shit,<br><br>saying "Excuse me" and "Thank you,"<br><br>and treating women with respect.<br><br>And gentlemen, please,<br>for the love of God,<br><br>stop sending people pictures<br>of your dick.<br><br>Right?<br><br>I don't get it!<br><br>Even if they ask for 'em, don't send 'em!<br><br>Have some class!<br><br>Every time I've been asked<br>for a dick pic...<br><br>both times...<br><br>I have sent that girl a picture<br>of Richard Nixon<br><br>with a caption that says,<br>"It's tricky."<br><br>The only time I would even<br>consider sending a girl<br><br>a picture of my dick is if she<br>was like, "Chris,<br><br>I would come over and have sex<br>with you right now,<br><br>but I genuinely don't think<br>you have a penis."<br><br>That would be the only time.<br>I'd be like, "Fuck you, bitch!"<br><br>With like today's paper<br>laying next to it. Just...<br><br>But as a way to hit on a woman,<br>I don't understand it.<br><br>First off, no way that's your best angle.<br><br>Genitals are not attractive.<br><br>Especially ours.<br><br>There's a reason it goes inside.<br><br>Yeah. Someone gave you a dick<br>and said, "Go hide this.<br><br>Yeah, make a good living<br>so you can hide this."<br><br>Even the vagina,<br>as part of the female form,<br><br>it's immaculate.<br><br>But when you solo it out,<br><br>even other women are like, "I don't...<br><br>I don't know what that is. Um...<br><br>Someone drop a sammich?<br><br>Uh...<br><br>Five second rule."<br><br>I also realize I'm older.<br>I'm 39,<br><br>so I'm not really<br>in the dick pic generation.<br><br>Also, if you're my age or older<br>and you've sent someone<br><br>a picture of your dick, you need<br>to fucking talk to somebody.<br><br>You got some issues.<br><br>'Cause I remember a time, when<br>in order to send a dick pic,<br><br>you'd have to go somewhere and<br>get that shit developed first.<br><br>Yeah. And then you had time<br>to think shit through.<br><br>And then about the time your dick pic<br><br>came down the one hour window...<br><br>you're like, "No, this is fucking stupid.<br><br>This is stupid!"<br><br>It was my dick, and it scared<br>the living shit out of me<br><br>when I saw it.<br><br>I'm not sending that to anybody.<br>No, no, no.<br><br>I'll just send her the card.<br>It's fine.<br><br>I remember when dick pics were a prank.<br><br>Remember when disposable cameras<br>were the shit?<br><br>Before we had cameras on our phones,<br><br>you'd go to a reception,<br><br>everyone had a disposable camera.<br><br>By the end of the night,<br>you'd walk by an empty table<br><br>with one lone disposable camera on it,<br><br>look around, grab it,<br>shove it down your pants,<br><br>take a picture,<br>put it right back on the table.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, 'cause they'd never know<br>whose dick it was.<br><br>Unless you were the only<br>black dude at the party.<br><br>You know...<br>"Goddamn it, Jimmy."<br><br>Otherwise, it was four months<br>later before they even<br><br>got that shit developed.<br><br>Some poor old woman like,<br>"Oh, look, it's Tammy's wedding.<br><br>There's Tammy.

Because...<br>I'm not paying for that shit.<br><br>Uh, first off,<br>not a big Mumford & Sons fan.<br><br>Second off, if I'm hanging out with you<br><br>and I know you've signed a<br>contract for over $100 million,<br><br>I'm not paying for shit.<br><br>Yeah, fuck you, dude.<br>You pay for shit,<br><br>it's not even on your register.<br><br>I pay for shit, I don't even get<br>to buy shoes next month.<br><br>And I'm gonna be fucking pissed.<br><br>So he sends them a bottle.<br>They come over to say thank you.<br><br>Turns out it's not Mumford & Sons.<br><br>It's just & Sons.<br><br>Mumford isn't there.<br>I don't know where he was.<br><br>I'm assuming he's back<br>at the hotel writing a song<br><br>that at some point goes...<br>♪ Oooh<br><br>So & Sons come over, start<br>talking to the Detroit Tigers.<br><br>I'm not really involved.<br>I kind of tune it all out.<br><br>But when I come back into focus,<br>& Sons are talking shit<br><br>to the Detroit Tigers about beer pong.<br><br>& Sons are like, "We'll fucking<br>whoop your ass<br><br>in some beer pong."<br><br>And the Detroit Tigers are like,<br>"We get paid very handsomely<br><br>to put balls places.<br><br>Fucking bring it."<br><br>And I said, "Hey, fellas.<br><br>My parents live about<br>eight minutes from here.<br><br>We could settle this."<br><br>The reason I said that<br>was 'cause I was fully aware<br><br>that both & Sons and the Detroit Tigers<br><br>have an entire floor at whatever<br>hotel they're staying at<br><br>to do whatever the fuck they wanna do.<br><br>So there was no reason<br>to come to my parents' house.<br><br>It was complete fake hospitality,<br><br>until they all turned around<br>and looked at me and said,<br><br>"Fuck yeah!<br>Let's go to your parents' house<br><br>and play beer pong!"<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>And that's when I went,<br>"Oh, shit!"<br><br>'Cause it is now two o'clock<br>on a Sunday night,<br><br>technically Monday morning.<br><br>My parents are not gypsies.<br>All right?<br><br>They have real jobs<br>with real responsibilities.<br><br>And that shit's about to start<br>in about six hours.<br><br>So I... what am I gonna do?<br><br>Like, I can't look at these guys<br>and be like, "You guys!<br><br>My parents." Right?<br><br>So I just said, "Fuck it,<br>let's roll the dice,<br><br>see what happens."<br><br>So we start to leave the bar.<br><br>As we do, my sister texted me<br>'cause she was also in town.<br><br>She said, "Hey, I'm out and about.<br><br>If you get home before I do,<br>will you walk my dog?"<br><br>And I texted back, "Unless<br>you're out and about<br><br>with the goddamn Dave Matthews Band,<br><br>you better get your fucking ass home,<br><br>'cause shit's about to go down<br>at Ma and Pa's house."<br><br>So at 2:30 on a Sunday night,<br><br>me, my sister, and about 12 dudes<br><br>roll into my parents' basement<br>and start throwing beer pong.<br><br>And let me tell you, shit got weird.<br><br>Like, weirder than<br>I've already described.<br><br>Like, my sister, who's 30,<br>ended up in her prom dress.<br><br>I don't know. I don't know<br>how that happened.<br><br>God bless her for being able<br>to fit in it.<br><br>But also, the fuck?<br><br>All right? So...<br><br>About 3:30, I decide to go out<br>and smoke some weed.<br><br>Ampersand Sons come with me.<br><br>But as it was the middle<br>of the baseball season,<br><br>the Detroit Tigers could not partake,<br><br>so they had to pretend like it<br>was the playoffs and watch.<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>So we come back in from smoking weed,<br><br>and my dad's downstairs and he's pissed.<br><br>Like, "What's up, Dad?"<br><br>And he's like, "What the fuck's<br>going on down here?"<br><br>I go, "Well, this is & Sons,<br><br>of Mumford & Sons.<br><br>And this is half<br>the Detroit Tigers' bullpen.<br><br>And we're playing beer pong.<br><br>And it was in that moment that I realized<br><br>my father was no longer sure<br>if he was actually awake.<br><br>You gotta look at it<br>from Dad's point of view.<br><br>He walks downstairs<br>in the middle of the night,<br><br>sees a bunch of weird dudes<br>that he kind of recognizes,<br><br>and my sister's in her prom dress.<br><br>Yeah. Shit's weird.<br><br>And Dad's confused as shit.<br>He's like, "I don't...<br><br>What... Is that<br>Justin Verlander?"<br><br>"Yes, sir, it is."<br><br>"Well, then I don't know what<br>the fuck's going on right now."<br><br>He walked upstairs, that was<br>the last I ever saw of him.<br><br>Not ever, just that night.<br>That would have been a weird...<br><br>That's a dark turn to that story.<br><br>That would have been funny<br>if he just was like,<br><br>"You know what? I'm just fucking<br>leaving the whole family<br><br>after this thing."<br><br>Whole next day,<br>I'm freaking the fuck out.<br><br>My parents have done a lot<br>for me over time.<br><br>I don't need to be pissing them<br>off over some bullshit.<br><br>So when my dad came home,<br>I was completely prepared<br><br>to take him out to dinner,<br>buy him some drinks,<br><br>make amends for the evening previous.<br><br>That was until my dad walked in the door<br><br>like he'd had the greatest<br>goddamn day of his life.<br><br>He walked in like... boom!<br>"What's up, everybody?<br><br>- How you doing? How you doing?<br>- All right!"<br><br>I go, "The fuck happened<br>to you today?"<br><br>And he just stopped, he goes,<br><br>"I fucking hated you<br>this morning."<br><br>He said, "I woke up on<br>about four hours sleep.<br><br>I cursed your name all the way to work.<br><br>But then I got to work,<br>and everyone started asking me<br><br>why I looked so tired and exhausted.<br><br>So I started bitching about<br>my son bringing home<br><br>the Detroit Tigers and Mumford & Sons<br><br>and playing beer pong all night.<br><br>And now I'm the coolest<br>motherfucker in the office."<br><br>Thank you very much, Denver.<br><br>God bless y'all.<br>See you next time.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

	<h1>Innocent (2017) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Francis is a nice, ordinary guy with a propensity to get into trouble in spite of himself: a dispute with his brother-in-law over a winning lottery ticket; a conflict with a wanted criminal over funeral urns; attempts to aid his elderly neighbour, his new tenant, and the ex he is still in love with, every time with unexpected (and certainly not positive) consequences.</p>

<br><br>- Oh no, are you kidding me?<br>Oh no! We're not the first!<br><br>- Don't worry,<br>it's going to be fine.<br><br>- What are we going to say?<br>- I dunno!<br><br>- I hate small talk!<br><br>- Look, just find yourself<br>3 or 4 basic questions, like...<br><br>- Like what?<br><br>- "Hey, did you buy a new boat?"<br><br>"Ever thought of getting a poodle?"<br><br>- OK great, what else?<br>- "Wow! Is that a new sofa?"<br><br>- I don't think he's got<br>this one in his collection.<br><br>I hope he'll like it!<br><br>- He'd better like it.<br>It's a 38$ bottle!<br><br>Why'd you put<br>a lottery ticket in there?<br><br>- Well, I picked the numbers<br>from his birthday.<br><br>And from his wedding anniversary...<br><br>And you know he loves money so...<br><br>I thought he'd like it...<br><br>- I hope you're not just<br>trying to impress him?<br><br>The bottle... the lottery ticket.<br>- Not at all!<br><br>- Not even a little bit?<br>- OK, yes, maybe just a little bit.<br><br>- Well, you know,<br>I'm glad that you like him.<br><br>Because all my exes,<br>they weren't really fond of Paul.<br><br>They thought that he didn't have a<br>shred of humanity.<br><br>- Well, I guess Paul is just<br>like your average rich asshole...<br><br>But who's still sort of likable.<br><br>- He has everything a man could want<br>don't you think?<br><br>- Of course not!<br><br>You're the one who's going out<br>with the prettiest of the 2 twins!<br><br>- Oh, yeah, you're right!<br>That's why I chose you honey.<br><br>- Oh, you're cute!<br>But I'm the one who chose you.<br><br>- Hello!<br>- Hey!<br><br>Wow! You guys are early... Come on in!<br><br>- So I started drinking a bit early.<br>But maybe it was a good thing,<br><br>because I'm not very good<br>with people I don't like.<br><br>But after a couple of drinks,<br>I get friendlier, you know.<br><br>But after a while,<br>even with 400$ bottles,<br><br>my stomach started<br>to get a little upset...<br><br>Especially since I don't have<br>a very high tolerance for alcohol.<br><br>So, the last thing<br>I remember : Blackout.<br><br>- Paul, calm down.<br>You're a bit drunk.<br><br>You mixed up the fours<br>with the twos and the fives.<br><br>And, that's fine!<br><br>You didn't win 2 million dollars!<br><br>Now, you're going to calm down<br>and look at the numbers again.<br><br>And I'm going to ask you<br>for 15 seconds of concentration.<br><br>15...15.<br><br>30... 30.<br><br>38... 38!<br><br>- Yeah?<br><br>- Guillaume, it's me.<br><br>I have a 2 million dollar<br>question for you.<br><br>- Go ahead.<br><br>- If I were to win at the lottery,<br>would I have to share with my wife?<br><br>- I already told you,<br><br>your wife has a right<br>to half of everything.<br><br>- Shit!<br><br>- You've won the jackpot,<br>you lucky son of a bitch?<br><br>Who gave you the ticket?<br><br>No one...<br><br>It's just the moron at my dealership<br>who forgot to fill up my new car.<br><br>So I had to stop at a gas station,<br>and the cashier was cute,<br><br>so I accepted her offer to buy<br>a lottery ticket and that's it.<br><br>- You didn't stop annoying<br>everyone at the office<br><br>that you were buying a Tesla.<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>- It's an electric car...<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>- Paul, let me tell you something<br>as your friend, not as your partner.<br><br>So listen to me carefully :<br><br>You have to give half the money to<br>the person who gave you that ticket.<br><br>- So first I have to give<br>half to my wife,<br><br>then half to the other dumb ass.<br><br>And you, since we're partners<br>and we share everything,<br><br>I also have to give you half.<br><br>And I wouldn't exist<br>without my parents.<br><br>So I'll give them their half too.<br><br>What am I talking about? They're<br>divorced! So it's one half each!<br><br>Come to think of it, maybe<br>I shouldn't claim the jackpot,<br><br>or I'll end up losing money!<br><br>- Add it up the way you want<br>but you have to share it.<br><br>- Or what?<br><br>- All your neighbors,<br>and your Facebook friends will think<br><br>that you're an egocentric narcissist<br>who only cares about money.<br><br>- Yeah... I guess I'd prefer<br>they didn't figure that out.<br><br>I'll call you back.<br>- OK.<br><br>- Go away!<br>- Paul? It's me, Francis!<br><br>I'm sorry, it's just that I sort<br>of clogged the downstairs toilet...<br><br>You wouldn't happen to have<br>a plunger by any chance?<br><br>- Yeah sure! Give me a minute.<br><br>- No problem.<br>Take your time, no rush!<br><br>- OK, Paul, you're going<br>to open the door...<br><br>you'll give him the plunger,<br><br>you're going to tell him :<br>"Francis, you're now a millionaire!"<br><br>He'll start crying like a baby.<br><br>You'll embrace him into your arms,<br><br>and everyone's going to be happy!<br><br>- Paul?<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>- I've never been so ashamed...<br>- Ouch!<br><br>- Will you finally tell me,<br>what really happened?<br><br>- I told you! I was waiting<br>for Paul to get me a plunger.<br><br>Then he came out,<br>with his nose covered in blood<br><br>and he punched me<br>for no freaking reason!<br><br>- Bullshit!<br><br>I just spoke to my sister.<br><br>And she told me that Paul<br>showed you his new car.<br><br>You wanted to try it out,<br>but you were a little too drunk,<br><br>so obviously he wouldn't<br>let you drink and drive!<br><br>You tried to grab his keys,<br><br>he stopped you,<br>so you hit him in the face!<br><br>- Your brother-in-law<br>is freaking insane!<br><br>- That's what happened isn't it!?<br><br>- No!<br><br>- You gotta learn how<br>to hold your booze, buddy!<br><br>- So, if I understand<br>correctly, he stopped you<br><br>from driving his new car<br>because you were too drunk.<br><br>- I don't give a flying shit<br>about his cars!<br><br>He's the kind of maniac<br>who spends his weekends<br><br>cleaning his cars with a toothbrush.<br><br>I didn't want to have anything<br>to do with his cars.<br><br>Just imagine<br>if I borrowed one of them<br><br>and I came back with a small bug<br>stuck on his windshield!<br><br>He'd never let me hear<br>the end of it!<br><br>- On a scale of one to ten,<br><br>how much alcohol<br>do you usually take?<br><br>Ten being the highest.<br>- One.<br><br>I never drink... usually.<br><br>- And how often<br>do you resort to violence?<br><br>- Never! Zero.<br><br>I'm telling you,<br>I'm not a violent person.<br><br>Sometimes I can get carried away,<br>but worst case scenario...<br><br>I get carried away with my words.<br><br>- OK, keep that in mind,<br>we'll get back to it later.<br><br>So after your mother passed away,<br><br>you found someone to sublet<br>her apartment.<br><br>- Excuse me, but it's sort of weird<br><br>to go back and forth like this,<br>don't you think?<br><br>Is it? Is it really necessary?<br><br>- It's the way I work,<br>it's my method...<br><br>- OK, I get it, you're trying<br>to find out if I'm lying.<br><br>Because you know that when you<br>mix up different events together...<br><br>Skip between different<br>timelines and all,<br><br>a liar is more likely to get<br>confused in all his lies.<br><br>But I'm not a liar, I swear!<br><br>- Calm down!<br>I call the shots in here.<br><br>Let me do my job the way I see fit.<br><br>- You're right. Sorry...<br><br>- I'd like you to tell me<br><br>what happened<br>with your upstairs neighbor.<br><br>- Well, it's quite simple really :<br>she screwed me!<br><br>Obviously, the whole place<br>pis due for a bit of a makeover...<br><br>My mom lived here almost<br>all her life you know.<br><br>That's the bed she got<br>for her wedding.<br><br>- Hey, does that mean<br>that you were conceived here?<br><br>- Oh yeah...<br><br>Yeah... I don't really want<br>to think about that!<br><br>- It must have been a shock...<br>to lose your mother like this.<br><br>- Yeah, I guess... You're never really<br>ready for that.<br><br>- Yup! I'll take it.<br><br>- The place is all yours...<br>as soon as I clear it out.<br><br>- You know what?<br><br>There's just one little thing<br>that I'd like to ask you.<br><br>- Uh, OK, like what?<br><br>- I just can't believe that<br><br>you'd sublet the apartment at the<br>same price that your mother paid.<br><br>It's not normal that our<br>rent is higher than hers!<br><br>- I know, but my mom lived<br>there all her life...<br><br>- Exactly why you should've tried<br>to make a profit on the sublet.<br><br>You're really hopeless when<br>it comes to business!<br><br>- You know, honey, just tell<br>yourself that we're lucky<br><br>to have found someone to<br>take back the lease.<br><br>- What are we gonna do<br>with your mom's stuff?<br><br>- I... left her the furniture.<br><br>- For how much?<br><br>- For nothing.<br><br>- Come on, Francis! You could've at<br>least sold it to her...<br><br>- I wanted to be generous. OK?<br><br>That girl hasn't had it<br>easy in life.<br><br>You know, her Ex left her,<br>he had the condo in his own name,<br><br>and left her with nothing ...<br><br>- Oh, you're such a nice guy!<br><br>I think she's all alone tonight.<br><br>Why don't go join her<br><br>and cuddle with her<br>in your mother's bed?<br><br>- Ah, you don't get it!<br><br>- Don't you think she's cute?<br><br>- Come on honey that's not it, it's<br>just that... I think we're cheap!<br><br>When was the last time that<br>we gave money to a charity?<br><br>Or even just a buck or two<br>at the grocery store?<br><br>- Well, we went to a fundraising<br>dinner just 3 months ago.<br><br>I remember, the ticketswere so<br>freaking expensive,<br><br>for shitty cafeteria food.<br><br>- Uh, you know<br>your expensive tickets...<br><br>your boss gave them to us.<br><br>- Oh yeah that's right. I forgot...<br><br>- Excuse me, did I say<br>something wrong?<br><br>- No, not at all, on the contrary!<br>- OK, sorry.<br><br>- You seem like a generous person.<br>It's something rare nowadays.<br><br>But in general,<br><br>people who give a lot usually<br>expect something in return.<br><br>- Yeah, but that's a plan<br>to be disappointed isn't it?<br><br>- Hum. Tell me all about your<br>encounter with Daniel Couture.<br><br>Why?<br><br>- Part of my job here,<br>pis to dig through your past.<br><br>To make sure that you really are<br>the person that you claim to be.<br><br>That's my job. Do you get it?<br><br>- Yes, yes, I'm sorry sir.<br>- Great.<br><br>Now, tell me all<br>about Daniel Couture.<br><br>- Eh boy!<br><br>So I had my bat<br>and I was ready to strike.<br><br>I wasn't really myself,<br>you understand...<br><br>- OK, stop. You're going a little<br>too fast. Hum? Calm down.<br><br>You're gonna start over<br>from the beginning. OK?<br><br>- From the start? Really?<br><br>- Yeah! Just act as if I didn't know<br>anything from your case.<br><br>- OK...<br><br>Well, Annie had just broken up<br>with me. So I went to see my mom,<br><br>because it cheers me up<br>when I talk to my mom.<br><br>Hey mom, I can't believe<br>it's already been a year.<br><br>Yeah, you're... you're surprised<br>to see me here, huh?<br><br>Well... I took the afternoon off,<br>to spend it with you.<br><br>Just the two of us!<br><br>It's been so long since<br>we've had time to chat.<br><br>I have so much stuff to tell you!<br><br>You know, the... the food<br>processor you gave me?<br><br>Well, a little piece<br>of it just broke.<br><br>And I can't use it anymore...<br>And I know it's silly...<br><br>but it's almost like if there was<br>little a piece of you<br><br>that I lost at the same time...<br><br>Not that you're like a food<br>processor, but you were so...<br><br>You know, you loved to cook so much.<br><br>So I applied for a new job<br>last week, it's at a Zoo...<br><br>Hello!<br>- Hum hum.<br><br>Sorry, it's... it's because<br>my father's right there.<br><br>- Hey, what's the odds, huh? I mean...<br><br>Well, go... go ahead, I... I'll...<br><br>- I won't be long.<br><br>- Ah, no rush,<br>I have the whole afternoon!<br><br>It's all good.<br><br>- Hey there, you old piece of shit!<br>This is my new fiancée.<br><br>Maurice, Honeybun.<br>Honeybun, Maurice.<br><br>- Nice to meet you, Maurice.<br><br>Dan told me a lot of<br>bad stuff about you.<br><br>- Daniel? Daniel Couture?<br><br>I'm so happy to put a face<br>on your beard.<br><br>I mean, a face on your name.<br><br>Because I come here<br>all the time to see my mother,<br><br>and I always take the time<br>to say hi to all her neighbors.<br><br>And I usually have a quick<br>chat with your father.<br><br>He's a sharp man, really.<br><br>- Is your name Daniel Couture<br>or Dan Kelly?<br><br>- I took my mother's name.<br><br>- What are you taking about?<br>Your mother's a Laviolette.<br><br>It's written ... it's right there...<br><br>Hey... Calm down dude...<br><br>I didn't want to meddle...<br><br>- Look, I don't really<br>want to know.<br><br>Anyway I'd rather be<br>a Mrs. Kelly than a Mrs. Couture.<br><br>- Come on, let's get out of here.<br>- Hold on babe!<br><br>We have a little<br>father & son ritual.<br><br>- What! Are you kidding<br>me right now?<br><br>Ark!<br><br>Sorry, but right now you have<br>your cock in my mother's face!<br><br>Would it be possible to stick it<br>back in your pants, please?<br><br>I can't believe what you're doing!<br><br>I just can't believe it! Come on!<br>- Don't worry.<br><br>It's just like cat litter.<br>It absorbs bad smells.<br><br>- It's been 8 years since<br>he's passed. Let it go!<br><br>- No, he's still here!<br><br>I can still hear his God<br>damn voice in my head.<br><br>Every day he tells me<br>that I am a fucking failure.<br><br>A loser and a disappointment.<br><br>On top of that, he's<br>ashamed of what I do!<br><br>- Well, from what I just saw,<br>he's got a good reason to be.<br><br>- Are you saying that<br>my father's right?<br><br>- No, no, I'm just saying that there<br>are some things that you can't do...<br><br>like urinate in an urn.<br><br>- He thinks my father's right!<br><br>- Choose your battles.<br>- You bet!<br><br>You know, when I was little,<br>we were 12 children in the family.<br><br>So when there was<br>a problem, my father,<br><br>he didn't have very much<br>time to talk with us<br><br>and go through his emotions.<br><br>His only way of talking<br>to us was with his fists.<br><br>- Ah, that sucks... but the good news<br>is, that you're an improved version.<br><br>You're able to talk.<br>- Not really.<br><br>- Excuse me, madam.<br><br>- So when you came out of the<br>mausoleum, you took your car,<br><br>and you followed him to his house.<br><br>And then you called the police?<br><br>- Uh... more or less<br><br>- How impulsive are you usually?<br><br>- Not really,<br>but when it comes to my mother,<br><br>I can be a little sensitive.<br><br>- You wanted revenge?<br><br>- My mother was a saint, OK?<br>She's never done anything wrong.<br><br>And she spent all her<br>time helping out others.<br><br>So I think that she<br>deserves some respect.<br><br>- You didn't really go<br>into details earlier<br><br>when you mentioned your<br>break up with Annie.<br><br>So I'd like you to go over it again.<br><br>Because you know in the police<br>report, it's a very detailed event.<br><br>- Annie, um... she really was...<br><br>my worst heartbreak ever.<br><br>I didn't recognize myself anymore.<br><br>I'd become possessive, jealous.<br><br>But, it won't happen again.<br><br>- You bet it won't!<br><br>- Not him again!<br><br>What?<br><br>- I miss you!<br><br>- Hey, get over it! It's been<br>6 months. I'm with Steve now.<br><br>- We just have one<br>life to live, right?<br><br>- Yeah, so?<br><br>- We get ourselves<br>2 tickets for Vegas,<br><br>we rent a small condo<br>next to Celine's house,<br><br>we get married and we have children.<br><br>- Great! Now, you listen<br>to me very carefully, OK?<br><br>- Sure, whatever you want, honey.<br><br>- You need help!<br><br>You're sick!<br>- You think?<br><br>- I don't think so, I'm sure of it!<br><br>They'll give you antidepressants<br>or something like that.<br><br>- OK, I... I'll go to the doctor's.<br><br>But in the meantime, I wrote you a<br>poem. Can I read it to you?<br><br>- I don't give a shit.<br><br>- Giraffe sedative with eucalyptus.<br><br>No, I can't take that<br>stuff, it's too strong!<br><br>Ah, it's organic, it must be OK.<br><br>Ah... tastes like shit!<br><br>- On a scale from 1 to 10, how much<br>would you rate your drug use?<br><br>- Zero! I don't do drugs...<br><br>- OK.<br>- Never, I'm serious!<br><br>- And what about giraffe sedatives?<br><br>In which category<br>should I label that?<br><br>- Natural organic products?<br><br>- By the way, I can see here<br><br>that you've been seeing a shrink<br>ever since you were 18.<br><br>- Yeah... you know at one<br>point in my life, I decided<br><br>that I wasn't going to be<br>one of those guys who...<br><br>dump all their shit on others<br>and annoy everyone<br><br>with their unresolved<br>problems from childhood.<br><br>So whenever I feel down I'd rather<br>give my money to a shrink<br><br>so that I don't have to be<br>a downer to everyone else.<br><br>- That's very wise.<br><br>- Thanks!<br><br>- Hi?<br><br>What the fuck!?<br><br>- Naughty girl!<br><br>- Hey! What the hell are you doing?<br><br>- Come on! Snatchbook!<br><br>- Snatchbook?<br>- Yeah!<br><br>- Sorry, it must be the girl<br>upstairs... Cynthia?<br><br>Yeah...<br><br>OK, hey, I'm so sorry.<br><br>- Are you OK, honey?<br><br>- Yes, darling, everything's fine!<br><br>- OK, I'm really sorry. I...<br><br>- Yes... it's upstairs.<br><br>- OK.<br>- Have a good day!<br><br>- Yeah, you too, ma'am.<br><br>- What're you doing?<br>- Hey, check this out.<br><br>It's like a dating app just for<br>people who want to fuck!<br><br>- Snatchbook?<br><br>OK, uh, and what are all these red<br>dots around our place?<br><br>- Well, that's everyone<br>that's um... available.<br><br>- To fuck? Right now?<br><br>- Yeah. Less than 5 minutes away!<br><br>- Are you kidding me?<br><br>- What's the world become!<br>It's crazy. It's degrading!<br><br>- Yes, yes, it's really<br>lowering mankind<br><br>to its most primary instincts, huh...<br><br>No, really that's just<br>putting love aside<br><br>and reducing everything<br>to pure sexual contact.<br><br>No, no, no, hey,<br>we're not sex dolls!<br><br>- Honey...<br><br>... admit it! It turns<br>you on doesn't it?<br><br>- It's amazing, sweetheart!<br><br>It's like a dream come true.<br>You can fuck on demand!<br><br>You know, it used to be<br>that you'd have<br><br>to drive up to an hour and a half<br>to have a fling with a girl.<br><br>Don't tell me that was<br>good for the planet!<br><br>Nowadays, you can go<br>by foot... in a dressing gown.<br><br>It's fantastic!<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>Good night honey!<br><br>- You don't think I'm right?<br><br>You're the one who's always saying<br><br>that we should get<br>more local products!<br><br>-Um hum.<br><br>- In any case,<br>one thing is for certain,<br><br>you're not someone who is<br>very stable in relationships.<br><br>Over the last three years,<br><br>you've been with Melissa, Julie,<br><br>Annie, Solange...<br><br>- No with Solange, it wasn't...<br><br>I've never... All I wanted<br>was to help her.<br><br>- Oh, you wanted to help her, sure,<br><br>but your name's<br>all over the police report.<br><br>And even Solange's own son is<br>accusing you of forcing his mother<br><br>to change her last will<br>in your favor.<br><br>- No! I mean, yes,<br>but I didn't force her.<br><br>- You didn't?<br><br>- She did it<br>all by herself, I swear.<br><br>Solange, are you OK?<br><br>- They stole my engine...<br>damn thieves!<br><br>- Your engine?<br><br>Solange... You're engine's<br>right there!<br><br>- That's not my engine!<br><br>Before I went to the mechanic<br>yesterday, I had a V8.<br><br>And when I came back I had a V6.<br><br>- Well, hum, OK, but... how is it less<br>efficient, I mean, your engine?<br><br>- It doesn't have any torque.<br>It doesn't have any power!<br><br>- So, you're saying that your<br>mechanic went through the trouble<br><br>of removing your old engine and<br>replacing it with a cheaper one?<br><br>- Precisely!<br><br>It's not everyone who paid for the<br>upgrade! A V8 engine is extra.<br><br>My Stephen, he worked overtime<br>to afford that V8.<br><br>- And did you tell your mechanic?<br><br>- Of course, I told him!<br><br>He gave me a lousy explanation.<br>He made it seem like I was crazy.<br><br>So, I called him a dirty thief and I<br>left without settling his bill.<br><br>- Solange! Get real,<br>no one stole your engine.<br><br>- You don't believe me?<br><br>- It's not that I don't believe you,<br>it's just that it isn't possible.<br><br>You know it's the same with humans,<br><br>as we get older, our<br>cells sort of stretch.<br><br>We get slower... you know,<br>huh, we're not as fast.<br><br>I guess that's not all news to you...<br><br>Well with a car's engine,<br>it's pretty much the same...<br><br>Your engine is just tired.<br><br>- You disappoint me Francis.<br>If only my Stephen was still here...<br><br>he never would've let that slide.<br><br>Take care...<br><br>- It's a V8!<br><br>God damn crooked mechanic!<br><br>- What do you want with me?<br>- You know what I want!<br><br>- So you believed her story?<br><br>- Well, I did some<br>research... on Google<br><br>and I found out that V8 models,<br>well, they come with V8 engines.<br><br>The V6 models come with V6<br>engines, and the V4...<br><br>- OK... OK I get the picture.<br><br>- Great! So perhaps now you<br>could try to explain how come<br><br>Solange has a V6 in her V8?<br><br>- I asked around to my guys<br>this morning and no one knows.<br><br>- But you've got to admit<br>it's a bit odd, right?<br><br>- Listen, you're not the only one<br><br>who'd like to figure out<br>what happened.<br><br>- Since Solange's engine<br>went missing<br><br>while her car was in your garage,<br><br>I just happen to have this feeling<br><br>that you're the one<br>who's responsible.<br><br>So we're going to try to<br>keep things simple, OK,<br><br>you'll just go ahead and replace<br>her engine with a new one.<br><br>- Are you crazy? A V8 is<br>worth at least 7000 bucks!<br><br>- Ha! You know its price!<br><br>- Of course I know its price, that's<br>my job. It doesn't mean I'm guilty.<br><br>- OK, look, personally,<br>I don't give a rat's ass<br><br>if Solange drives around<br>with a V6 in her V8.<br><br>If it were up to me,<br>she could strut around on a scooter<br><br>while drinking V8.<br><br>As long as she's happy,<br>I don't give a shit!<br><br>The only thing that pisses me off is<br>that crooked mechanics like you<br><br>rip off helpless people<br><br>while thinking that no<br>one will ever notice it.<br><br>That, truly disgusts me!<br>I can't live with that.<br><br>I don't sleep well at night<br>because of things like that.<br><br>- So you accuse me of being a crook!<br><br>While I bust my agent Sans-Secret<br>every day for my clients<br><br>instead of being home<br>with my children.<br><br>That really pisses me off!<br><br>- Very touching story.<br><br>- If you're so convinced,<br>then just sue me.<br><br>- Great idea! I'll sue you.<br><br>- You don't have any proof anyway.<br><br>- Uh, yes I do! I have<br>Solange's car as proof.<br><br>- OK, 8 o'clock tomorrow<br>morning, bring me her car.<br><br>- That's much better!<br><br>-Yes?<br><br>Hum hum.<br><br>Yeah, he's right here<br>in front of me.<br><br>OK... Very well, thanks.<br><br>We just received your lab results.<br><br>It's negative...<br><br>- Oh! Great... that's really great!<br><br>- You seem relieved.<br><br>Were you afraid<br>that we'd find something?<br><br>- Oh, no, no, no! I know I'm clean.<br><br>It's just nice to... make<br>it official, you know.<br><br>- Hum hum.<br><br>- Hey... Hey!<br><br>This is going to be<br>the most important apology<br><br>of your whole life!<br><br>- Winner of the two<br>million dollar jackpot?<br><br>- Yes! Yes!<br>- No no no!<br><br>- "Should I share with<br>my brother-in-law?"<br><br>"Don't give him a penny, keep<br>the money, let him rot in hell."<br><br>I think I just understood<br>what happened last night.<br><br>- I don't care what you understand,<br>and what you don't understand,<br><br>you're going to put your<br>ego aside for once<br><br>you're going to call him<br>right now to apologize!<br><br>Don't forget that you're<br>deeply sorry for everything.<br><br>You put some real heart into it<br>and then you congratulate him!<br><br>- Congratulate him?<br>- Yes!<br><br>- I'm the one who bought the ticket!<br><br>He's the one who should be<br>here kissing my ass.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>- Hi there you greedy asshole!<br>How are you doing this morning?<br><br>- Ah, try to put yourself<br>in my shoes, Francis.<br><br>I go to the washroom...<br><br>I take a look at the<br>lottery numbers on my phone.<br><br>And I notice that I just<br>won 2 million dollars, eh.<br><br>And the only thing I was wondering<br>while I was glaring at my ticket,<br><br>was trying to figure out<br>a way to make sure<br><br>that I wouldn't have to give<br>you a God damn penny!<br><br>After that, well, you know the rest.<br><br>- If you didn't want to share, you<br>didn't have to punch me in the face!<br><br>- Oh, that's because<br>I needed to make sure<br><br>that my friends would understand<br><br>why I wouldn't share<br>the jackpot with you.<br><br>- You know what? You're<br>fucking insane man!<br><br>- You know it's all<br>your fault, right?<br><br>If you hadn't given me a ticket,<br><br>I wouldn't have had to choose<br>between your friendship and money.<br><br>- Ark!<br><br>- That's why I'm<br>successful in life.<br><br>I never mix family with business.<br><br>- That's so true.<br><br>- I'm sorry I didn't<br>believe you before.<br><br>- I don't know if I'll be<br>able to continue living<br><br>knowing that we gave 2 million to<br>the worst asshole in the universe.<br><br>- Me neither...<br><br>My sister...<br><br>My sister, she can<br>make this right!<br><br>- You're wasting your time.<br>Your sister isn't going to help us.<br><br>- How much is it really worth,<br>your relationship with your sister?<br><br>Think about it.<br><br>- You know, she owes<br>everything to Paul.<br><br>She'll do anything to stay with him!<br><br>- She wants to play dirty?<br>Well, I can play dirty too!<br><br>- Fuck me!<br><br>- Guillaume?<br><br>Isn't that Paul's partner?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Hey, you know, your sister...<br>she's just a slut.<br><br>- I know.<br><br>But Guillaume, you know<br>he's... well equipped.<br><br>- What about you, did<br>you sleep with him too?<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>But that was before<br>I was with you.<br><br>- You can't betray me like that!<br><br>We swore that we'd<br>never tell anyone.<br><br>It was a secret between sisters!<br><br>You want to fuck up my<br>marriage, is that it?<br><br>You're just jealous!<br><br>Do you want me to<br>tell you something?<br><br>If only you'd listened<br>to mom and dad<br><br>and you'd found yourself<br>a rich husband,<br><br>not a God damn loser<br>like your boyfriend.<br><br>Well, we wouldn't<br>be in this situation!<br><br>You really want to<br>fuck up my marriage?<br><br>Well tell him you<br>backstabbing bitch!<br><br>- Its settled...<br><br>We won't get a penny... and I never<br>want to see my sister again.<br><br>- When you think about<br>it... she may be right.<br><br>Why are you with a guy like me?<br><br>- Because I love you...<br>and I know that you love me.<br><br>And we don't really need<br>that much money to be happy, do we?<br><br>- Yes. Well, I mean,<br>we can live without it, but...<br><br>- I mean think about it,<br><br>we've never been as unhappy<br>as we've been since this morning.<br><br>- That's true.<br><br>Come to think of it, if it<br>hadn't been for his birthday,<br><br>I never would've bought<br>that lottery ticket.<br><br>- Good point!<br><br>- I love your bungalow.<br><br>-And I love<br>your old Volvo!<br><br>- We don't need anything else.<br>- That's so true!<br><br>- You know what... they<br>should keep the money!<br><br>They need it more than we do!<br>- Right on!<br><br>In the end I guess...<br><br>it's a good thing.<br><br>- It's a great thing,<br>because I love you honey!<br><br>- I love you too!<br><br>- The only thing that sucks, is that<br>you're supposed to deserve a gift.<br><br>- Holy shit... you're onto something!<br><br>What?<br><br>- "Deserve"? Is that what you said?<br>- Yeah...<br><br>- And they don't deserve it!<br><br>We're going to get our ticket.<br>- What do you mean?<br><br>- We're gonna get<br>our ticket back!<br><br>It's ours!<br><br>- You have 2 seconds<br>to apologize to my mom.<br><br>"NO!"<br><br>Sorry? I didn't hear you.<br><br>"You heard me! When I<br>was young, my father..."”<br><br>I know, your father hit you<br>and I don't give a shit!<br><br>"You're just a little skinny loser<br><br>"who used to get his ass<br>kicked in the schoolyard.<br><br>"And it's still the same today,<br>you're a God damn coward.”<br><br>You're right! But that just changed.<br><br>Sorry, I can't hear you.<br><br>Oh, you'd like to apologize,<br>but you can't speak anymore?<br><br>So sad!<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>He needs to apologize to my mother.<br><br>- Forget it. Dan is never<br>going to apologize.<br><br>You don't get it do you?<br><br>Deep inside Dan is just<br>an injured little boy<br><br>who needs to be loved.<br><br>- Ah, OK! That changes everything,<br>you could've told me before.<br><br>Silly me! Here I thought that<br>he was just a crazy psycho<br><br>who couldn't control<br>his own emotions<br><br>and who was always looking<br>to pick a fight!<br><br>I'm not leaving here<br>without an apology!<br><br>- I beg you, please!<br><br>I'm sure that you're<br>smarter than this!<br><br>Give me your bat.<br><br>- Mike, she knows my real name :<br>Daniel Couture.<br><br>- I still don't understand why<br>you brought her there.<br><br>- I told you, she really<br>wanted to meet my father.<br><br>- Your father's dead!<br><br>- Do you think<br>I don't fucking know that?<br><br>I'm the one who freaking killed him!<br><br>- You have 2 choices:<br>either you get rid of her<br><br>or you jump on a plane and you<br>two get the fuck out of here.<br><br>- Listen, I know that my new<br>identity was expensive<br><br>but I really love this girl, OK?<br><br>Tell that to the boss.<br><br>I'm going to run some errands.<br><br>I'll have a little surprise<br>for you when I come back.<br><br>- Well...<br>- Hum?<br><br>- I'd really like you to apologize<br>for what you did earlier.<br><br>- You're right. I'm sorry...<br><br>You never should've met my father!<br><br>- Hold on!<br><br>Thank you...<br>- Don't thank me.<br><br>I'm going to do what I should've<br>done from the start :<br><br>I'll go straight to the police.<br><br>I know that you love him,<br>but he's a God damn psychopath.<br><br>And he should be locked up.<br>He's a... Pfff! You know.<br><br>Solange, where's your car?<br>- I don't know...<br><br>- That fat fucking fucker!<br>God damn crooked ass hole!<br><br>There you have it!<br><br>Yes sir!<br><br>Yes hi, I'd like to report a<br>vehicle theft, please,<br><br>at 4224 Remembrance.<br><br>Yeah, and I can even describe<br>the suspect to you if you want.<br><br>He's currently wearing jeans<br>and some kind of ugly jacket.<br><br>Would you like to talk to him?<br><br>OK, so hurry up please!<br><br>It's the police,<br>they're on their way!<br><br>- Sure... Do you want to know<br>what happened here?<br><br>- No need! I know exactly<br>what happened.<br><br>You tried to get rid of the<br>evidence and you got caught!<br><br>So now you look like<br>a guilty dumb ass!<br><br>By the way, it's two<br>separate thefts!<br><br>The engine and<br>then the car!<br><br>So you're going to be<br>charged for both, big guy.<br><br>Well, I say big, but<br>you're not that tall.<br><br>More like a... fat gnome.<br>A... hairy leprechaun...<br><br>A mini Hagrid!<br><br>- Police custody.<br><br>Last night, Solange...<br>she got chased by a police car.<br><br>She drove through<br>at least two red lights<br><br>and it took a roadblock<br>to finally stop her.<br><br>Have a look!<br><br>- Oh, shit!<br><br>- By the way, I found the answer<br>to your engine problem.<br><br>When you're too cheap to buy a V8,<br><br>you just get a sticker,<br>it's a lot cheaper!<br><br>Anything to say about that?<br><br>- Well, I guess it's all<br>good. It's... it's great.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>I don't know what to say...<br>- There's nothing to say...<br><br>- Cool, well, let's not<br>say anything then.<br><br>- Perfect.

	<h1>The Goat and Her Three Kids (2019) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Secluded from the world, a single mother of three has to defend that what's left of her family, at all cost, from a cold blooded killer. Based on one of the best known Romanian fairy tales (The Goat and Her Three Kids by Ion Creanga), this short film aims to unveil the true nature of the famed bed time story and to treat the audience to a different perspective, one that offers a glimpse at what the tragedy actually looks like beyond the happy songs and colorful characters.</p>

out<br>with Brian and Roger<br><br>and pay tribute to Freddie Mercury.<br><br>♪ My heart is a ghost town ♪<br><br>There's been a perfect storm<br>in 2018 that happened.<br><br>Queen built up to a point<br>where they could headline<br><br>the Hollywood Bowl again,<br><br>and it would be<br>the hottest ticket in town.<br><br>And then the 'Bohemian Rhapsody'<br>movie came out.<br><br>In the

kids?<br><br>Like, how cool is that?<br><br>What's actually been quite<br>sort of dumbfounded<br><br>is that we've actually<br>stayed together all these years.<br><br>And when you think about it,<br>I mean, we are the only sort of,<br><br>you know, four grand dames<br><br>that have actually<br>sort of stuck together.<br><br>We have to survive<br>and we have to survive together.<br><br>And so many groups<br><br>who are on the brink<br>of the world's riches<br><br>don't realise that.<br><br>They suddenly think<br>they're too big for the group<br><br>and they disappear off.<br><br>And they throw away the magic,<br><br>which is a group<br>which works together.<br><br>It's something very precious.<br><br>If you find it in your lifetime,<br>even once, you're so lucky.<br><br>And we are incredibly lucky.<br><br>We found it twice, I have to say.<br><br>When we very first met Adam,<br>he appeared to be more of a boy.<br><br>I now see him<br>as an incredibly accomplished man.<br><br>Roger and I have<br>a better relationship<br><br>than we used to have.<br><br>And that's important.<br><br>You know,<br>we disagree on almost everything,<br><br>but we have<br>that kind of mutual respect.<br><br>And when we get to play together,<br>something happens.<br><br>And it was always there<br>from the beginning,<br><br>like way back to the jazz club room<br>in 1969<br><br>or whenever it was.<br><br>A long time ago, isn't it?<br><br>Chop, chop.<br><br>- All right, then?<br>- All right?<br><br>Let's do it.<br><br>Have a good one.<br><br>Yeah.

Watch the hook, man.<br><br>Aren't you gonna count it?<br><br>I trust that it's all there.<br><br>I'd thumb through it, but no thumb.<br><br>It's an awful lot of cash<br>just to get you to open a gate.<br><br>And to keep my mouth shut.<br><br>You see, without the proper motivation,<br><br>I might just be tempted to call<br>Fish and Wildlife.<br><br>Bet they'd be real interested<br>in exactly what you want<br><br>with those protected crocodiles.<br><br>You give Ms. Murdoch my regards.<br><br>And boys,<br>you all be careful with these crocs.<br><br>Take my word for it.<br><br>First bite's always the worst.<br><br>- Jim, we ain't done here yet.<br>- Firearms.<br><br>And you still owe me<br>the last three numbers.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Pardon me. Crossing. Watch the gun.<br><br>No problemo.<br><br>I'm injecting her<br>with the mutated cells now.<br><br>Finito.<br><br>What now?<br><br>Now? Now we wait<br>for the new cells to take.<br><br>This female snake<br>is genetically engineered<br><br>which means that all of her<br>biological process has been accelerated.<br><br>She'll grow faster, molt faster.<br><br>Lay eggs faster. Got it. How long?<br><br>She should lay her eggs<br>in the next 24 to 48 hours.<br><br>Dear God.<br><br>Great. Wake me up<br>when it's time to go home.<br><br>We'll get her back to the lab<br><br>and everything else will be done<br>in an incubator. Okay?<br><br>Our friend here is awake.<br><br>That's not possible.<br>I gave that thing enough tranquilizer<br><br>to knock out an elephant for 12 hours.<br><br>You know this isn't an elephant, right?<br><br>It's getting loose.<br><br>It's getting loose!<br><br>The snakes!<br><br>Shit!<br><br>Shit.<br><br>Hey, Tully.<br><br>New sunglasses? Nice.<br><br>You know I can see the deer, right?<br><br>Deer just jumped out<br>in front of my truck.<br><br>What about the one in the back there?<br><br>I forgot. There was two of them.<br><br>You sure that's the story<br>you want to stick to?<br><br>It's the God's honest truth this time.<br><br>Isn't that a bullet hole?<br><br>Looks like about a .308 there,<br>wouldn't you say?<br><br>A .308?<br><br>I don't know anything about ballistics.<br><br>Ballistics?<br><br>That's a real big word for you, Earl.<br>I'm impressed.<br><br>Don't worry.<br>I know it wasn't you that shot him.<br><br>Earl Junior!<br><br>Why don't you come out<br>from behind that bush over there?<br><br>Let's have a little chat before I have<br>to cart your old man off to jail.<br><br>He's just a kid, Tully.<br>You're scaring him half to death.<br><br>Poaching is poaching, Earl.<br><br>You know the deal,<br><br>the fine or the time.<br><br>The fine.<br><br>Have a nice day.<br><br>That ain't no way to treat a citizen!<br><br>First beer's on me later.<br><br>Have you seen her?<br>Have you seen my baby?<br><br>Daphne! Daphne!<br>Have you seen her? She's missing.<br><br>- My baby.<br>- Get away from me, lady.<br><br>- No.<br>- Sheriff! Sheriff, stop!<br><br>Have you found her?<br>Have you found my baby?<br><br>We're pretty sure that<br>she's with Jared, Mrs. Mailer.<br><br>No, Sheriff, what if she's not with him?<br><br>I told her to stay away<br>from that piece of trash.<br><br>I'd cut that sucker's balls off<br>myself if I...<br><br>If I could do it legally, that is.<br><br>She's really a good girl, Sheriff.<br><br>Yes, yes, I know. She's been an absolute doll<br>since she got out of jail this time.<br><br>But, Sheriff, it's been two days.<br><br>I'm not stupid. I watch reality TV.<br><br>After the first 48 hours,<br><br>it's practically a cold case.<br><br>Okay. Well, we're doing<br>our best to locate her<br><br>and I promise I'll be in touch<br>as soon as I hear something, okay?<br><br>Thank you, Ms. Mailer.<br><br>- You have a good day.<br>- Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey!<br><br>Stop!<br><br>Sheriff.<br><br>Mr. Mayor.<br><br>What was that all about?<br><br>Her daughter went missing.<br><br>Last seen?<br><br>Hiking outside the fence at Black Lake.<br><br>- Outside the fence?<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>Is this something that<br>I should be worried about?<br><br>Because if it is,<br>I'll have to call in a prescription.<br><br>The daughter is a grown woman, sir.<br><br>We think that she took off<br>with the boyfriend.<br><br>The mother's not too fond of him.<br>But, we are considering other possibilities.<br><br>Good.<br><br>I gave you this job because<br>you know the town, its people,<br><br>and to make sure that<br>the crocodiles at Black Lake<br><br>don't cause any problems.<br><br>You gave me this job, sir,<br>because nobody else wanted it.<br><br>I sent Ferguson down to take a look.<br><br>Ferguson?<br><br>I have complete faith in your abilities.<br><br>I'm behind you all the way.<br><br>But if you screw up, I'll throw you<br>under the bus in a heartbeat.<br><br>- Steve, how are you? Nice to see you.<br>- Mr. Mayor.<br><br>Thanks for the building permit.<br><br>Remember, it's an election year.<br><br>Ice cream! The mayor has coupons<br>for free ice cream!<br><br>- Coupons for free ice cream, everyone!<br>- What the...<br><br>Sheriff, can you hear me?<br><br>Yeah, Ferguson, where are you?<br><br>Is that you?<br><br>Yeah.

My mom was a Delta.<br><br>So, what, she, like,<br>forced you into it or something?<br><br>No.<br><br>She died when I was little.<br><br>It was just me and my dad.<br><br>So I thought that becoming a Delta<br>would be something to remember her by.<br><br>That's sweet.<br><br>I mean, I want to throw up.<br><br>But it's sweet. Seriously.<br><br>Don't think I don't see you two<br>sitting over here snickering<br><br>or laughing or whatever.<br><br>You do know that those words<br>mean the same thing, right?<br><br>What I do know is that<br>you are two of the sorriest pledges<br><br>I have ever seen in my life.<br><br>And if you want a hope in hell<br>of getting into this sorority,<br><br>you better get it together.<br><br>Well, let's take one<br>for Mom and my studies.<br><br>This is a mess.<br><br>- This happened last night?<br>- Right about then.<br><br>We don't get many eyewitnesses out here<br>in the middle of the night,<br><br>which, I'm sure, was the point.<br><br>I'm not gonna candy coat this<br>for you, Sheriff.<br><br>If this fence was down for even an hour,<br><br>it's entirely possible that<br>some of the crocs escaped.<br><br>I mean, there's a chance<br>we can track some of them, but...<br><br>Then what are we waiting for?<br><br>Well, I mean, you obviously<br>know a lot about breeding.<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>That came out wrong.<br><br>Let me clarify that.<br><br>Aroostook Station Wildlife.<br><br>Hey, Sheryl, it's Tully.<br>I'm out here at Black Lake,<br><br>just trying to take my foot<br>out of my mouth.<br><br>You do that a lot, Tully.<br><br>If you could do me a solid<br>and get Falmouth on the line<br><br>and have them send over<br>all the transponder numbers<br><br>for the crocs they tagged<br>out here on their last survey,<br><br>that would be great.<br><br>And if you could make it snappy,<br>I would be very happy.<br><br>We could have a very serious situation<br>on our hands here.<br><br>- I don't know, I'll pass it on.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Yep. Thanks.<br>- Tully, what about that raise I...<br><br>Okay, bye, bye. Bye. Bye.<br><br>What I was saying earlier is that<br><br>any crocs that were born<br>after they were tagged<br><br>aren't gonna have any transponders.<br><br>So we're gonna have to hunt<br>the old-fashioned way.<br><br>And if we're gonna do that,<br><br>it's gonna take a lot more than<br>that peashooter to stop 'em.<br><br>Don't you worry about me.<br><br>If there's one thing I'm good at,<br>it's stopping crocodiles.<br><br>So I've heard.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Here's a list of all the transponders<br>that they tagged the crocs with.<br><br>Looks like a lot.<br><br>Yeah, but this is not right.<br><br>This is last week's readout. Hold on.<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>The whole system went down.<br><br>Is that normal?<br><br>Well, it's never gone down on me before,<br>so to speak.<br><br>There's a first time<br>for everything, I guess.<br><br>- That's kind of convenient timing.<br>- Not really.<br><br>Well, I mean, a bizarre accident<br>blows a hole in our security gate<br><br>around the same time<br>the tracking system goes down.<br><br>We don't even know<br>how many crocs have escaped, if any.<br><br>True, true.<br>We don't know how many escaped,<br><br>but we do know where they're going.<br><br>Check this out. Pull up this map.<br><br>All right. This is us.<br><br>And here's Black Lake.<br><br>Now I'm willing to bet<br>they've probably consumed<br><br>most of the lake's resources, so,<br><br>the crocs are gonna be headed<br>toward the nearest source of ready food,<br><br>which is right there.<br><br>Clear Lake.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Where do you want us to start?<br><br>Start in there.<br><br>That's where we found him<br>the first time.<br><br>If we're lucky,<br>he'll be drinking his way through<br><br>that money we gave him.<br><br>You two wait out here.<br><br>Try to blend in with the locals.<br><br>I'll go around the back.<br><br>What's up?<br><br>What's up?<br><br>Come on, Beth, answer the phone, please.<br><br>Look, just try to relax.<br><br>You know, she's probably out<br>having some fun with friends.<br><br>Besides, we don't even know<br>if the crocs did escape<br><br>or even if they made it to Clear Lake.<br><br>Look, I'm not gonna be able to relax<br>until I know my daughter is safe.<br><br>So, I'm gonna go look for her.<br><br>We're working here, Tull.<br><br>Once that fence is fixed, your lake is safe.<br>I can't say the same thing about my daughter.<br><br>So, I'm gonna go try and find her,<br>you can come or not.<br><br>I'm coming!<br><br>I was never here.<br><br>You got it, boss.<br><br>- Hey, buddy, what can I get you?<br>- I'm looking for Jim Bickerman.<br><br>Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim who?<br><br>I'm still having a hard time<br>with that last name.<br><br>Bickersteen?<br><br>Bickerman. Jimmy Bickerman.<br><br>Why didn't you say so?<br><br>Haven't seen him.<br><br>Hi, Jim.<br><br>Happy hour start a little early today?<br><br>Don't hassle me, Ms. Murdoch.<br>I'm a cripple.<br><br>Physically challenged<br>is the preferred term now.<br><br>I'm sorry. Did that hurt?<br><br>Come on, Jim.<br>We still have business to discuss.<br><br>Let me help you up.<br><br>Did you see that?<br><br>I think I got me a lawsuit here.<br><br>- He's actually kind of cute.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You ready?<br><br>- Born ready.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Ladies, Andrew is gonna<br>give Hannah here...<br><br>- Heather.<br>- Close enough.<br><br>A show to remember.<br><br>Damn, it's cold.<br><br>- I'm gonna go up front.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Baby, you know tops are<br>optional on my boat.<br><br>Does that line really work?<br><br>Well, I am the captain.<br><br>You handle the throttle.<br><br>Hit it!<br><br>Yeah, baby.<br><br>Let's go over there.<br><br>What? I'm serious. You're so much hotter<br>than the other girls.<br><br>How about a little suck face?<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Stop! Stop the boat!<br><br>Why? What's wrong?<br><br>He's gone. He's gone!<br><br>Something attacked him.<br>I think a giant alligator or something!<br><br>Yeah, yeah, he's probably joking around.<br><br>- I'll circle back and pick him up.<br>- I'm sorry.<br><br>I'm allergic to water.<br><br>He'll be okay, all right?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>What the...<br><br>Very funny, Andrew!<br><br>That was a $200 rope.<br><br>Maybe we should get back to the beach.<br><br>I can't leave Andrew<br>in the middle of the lake,<br><br>joke or no joke.<br><br>Not again. Cut it out.<br><br>That's not funny.<br>We've seen this before.<br><br>Andrew?<br><br>I did not give them permission<br>to get out of the water!<br><br>Oh, my God, they're gone!<br><br>Melissa!<br><br>Oh, my God! Help me!<br><br>Go, go!<br><br>- Oh, my God!<br>- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<br><br>Go, go!<br><br>- Help me!<br>- No, Heather, no!<br><br>Melissa, help me!<br><br>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<br>What do we do? Tiffani!<br><br>I don't think we can outrun them!<br><br>- God!<br>- Wait! I have an idea!<br><br>What?<br><br>Help me!<br><br>No!<br><br>Need I tell you that you're going<br>just a tad over the speed limit?<br><br>- Write me a ticket.<br>- Don't tempt me.<br><br>Ferguson, you out there?<br><br>Come in.<br><br>Ferguson, come in.<br><br>- Excuse me, bro. Official police business.<br>- Ferguson.<br><br>- Just, just one minute. Thanks.<br>- Okay.<br><br>This is Ferguson. Who's this?<br><br>It's your mother, Ferguson.<br><br>I need you to get out to the Clear<br>Lake Marina and get everybody out.<br><br>The lake is officially closed.<br><br>Blame it on red algae<br>or brain-eating amoebas.<br><br>I don't really care.<br>Just don't let anybody<br><br>hear you say the word "Crocodile."<br><br>We don't need to start a panic.<br>Am I clear?<br><br>Roger that, Sheriff.<br><br>Ix-nay on the ocodile-cray.<br><br>Where's my...<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Come on! Come on! Hurry!<br><br>Get in the car.<br><br>- Where's Amber?<br>- I tried to save her, but she didn't make it.<br><br>What? Oh, my God!<br><br>Wait. You can't come in this car.<br><br>- Why?<br>- I don't like your bikini.<br><br>That's it. We're leaving.<br><br>God, can you believe it?<br>I left the keys on the beach.<br><br>You mind going back and getting them,<br>big sister?<br><br>What? Are you nuts?<br><br>Come on, come on, get out of here!<br><br>Why aren't they leaving?<br><br>Go! Go away!<br><br>Yeah, that'll work.<br>Just tell them to leave.<br><br>I'm getting out of here!<br><br>No! Cassie, no!<br><br>No!<br><br>She's not gonna make it.<br><br>Better her than me.<br><br>- We got to help her.<br>- I volunteer...<br><br>- Her.<br>- Why her?<br><br>It's not like she's gonna get in anyway.<br><br>Do you try to be a bitch<br>or does it just come naturally?<br><br>Our only hope is Tiff's car.<br><br>Okay? We go on three!<br><br>One, two, three!<br><br>No!<br><br>I got you! I got you.<br><br>I got you.<br><br>We got to distract them.<br><br>- Who's got something we can use?<br>- Like what?<br><br>I need a can of hair spray.<br>Something flammable.<br><br>How about spray tanner?<br><br>Somebody must have left it there.<br><br>That'll work. Who's got a lighter?<br><br>Guilty as charged.<br><br>Help! Help!<br><br>They're gonna... They're gonna...<br><br>No, they're not. It's okay.<br><br>When I say the word,<br>just be ready to run, okay?<br><br>Wait a second, I'm in charge here.<br>I say the word.<br><br>I'm listening!<br><br>Hey! Over here!<br><br>Now?<br><br>Now! Now! Now!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>I'm not getting a signal.<br><br>We must be out of range.<br><br>It's a snake skin.<br><br>One of them is molting.<br><br>It's too big for the males.<br><br>It's come from the female.<br><br>She may be ready to lay her eggs.<br><br>- We know one thing for sure.<br>- Which is what?<br><br>She's still growing.<br><br>Yeah, like she wasn't<br>big enough already.<br><br>Move out!<br><br>I'm fine.<br><br>Just fine. Thanks for asking.<br><br>Okay, sorry. Sorry.<br><br>People of the visitors' center,<br>I need you to leave the premises right away.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to panic.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>There is no need to panic.<br>Everything will be okay.<br><br>By order of the Aroostook<br>County sheriff,<br><br>I need you to all remove your vehicles<br>and exit in a calm and orderly manner.<br><br>There's no need for pushing and shoving.<br><br>Get out of the way, nerd boy!<br><br>Be polite, people!<br><br>This is a major emergency! Run!<br>Your life may depend on it!<br><br>Stop. Stop!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Sheriff...<br><br>What the hell is it?<br><br>It's crocodile prints.<br><br>That tracker of yours<br>showing anything around here?<br><br>No, no, no. It's still not working.<br>I left it in the truck.<br><br>That's weird.<br>Where the hell did that thing go?<br><br>Do something!<br><br>Working on it!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where you going?<br><br>Damn!<br><br>Sheriff!<br><br>Sheriff!<br><br>Sheriff, stop! What are you doing?<br><br>I'm going after the snake!<br><br>Hell, no.<br><br>I'm not about to become<br>part of the food chain.<br><br>I'm going back to the truck<br>to find my daughter.<br><br>What?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on, this way.<br><br>I'm coming. I'm coming.<br>I got a bum knee.<br><br>Sheriff, this is Ferguson.<br><br>Sheriff, you copy?<br><br>Yeah, I hear you, Ferguson. Go.<br><br>This is Ferguson.<br><br>I know, Ferguson. You just radio-ed me.<br><br>Yeah, I just wanted you to know<br>that the visitors' center is secure<br><br>and I've locked all the perimeter gates.<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>By any chance you come across<br>a group of sorority girls out there?<br><br>Negative, Sheriff.<br>Just a bunch of families.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Did somebody else go missing?<br><br>I'm with Tull. Meet me on the fire road.<br>We got another problem.<br><br>Does it involve a C-R-O-C?<br><br>Now, Ferguson!<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Damn it! Still no answer.<br><br>I've never seen anything<br>like that in my life.<br><br>No, me neither.<br><br>I mean, it... It had to be an anaconda.<br><br>The green anaconda, that's the largest<br>species in recorded history.<br><br>That thing wasn't just large, Tull.<br>It was, it was ginormous.<br><br>I know. I saw it. I can't explain it.<br><br>I mean, I've heard stories<br>of these snakes<br><br>getting to be 50 or more feet long,<br>eating cattle and people.<br><br>But this is deep down in the jungles,<br>and they're just legends.<br><br>Maybe not.<br><br>Well, even if it's not a story,<br>they're indigenous to the Amazon.<br><br>What the hell are they doing here?<br><br>It had to have come from somewhere.<br><br>It had to be a person<br>who brought it here.<br><br>Great minds think alike.<br><br>How did it get so big?<br><br>I don't know. That's the least<br>of my worries at this point.<br><br>You need more?<br><br>My daughter is still out there.<br><br>And any of these snakes<br>could be out there with her.<br><br>And here I thought the crocs were bad.<br><br>We can't just stay here.<br><br>Maybe we can. I mean,<br>someone will figure out we're missing<br><br>and send someone to find us. Right?<br><br>That could take days.<br><br>We'll starve to death.<br><br>Trust me, some of you girls<br>could stand to lose a little weight.<br><br>Oh, my God. Do I have to do everything?<br><br>Switch with me.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>You were serious about stealing cars?<br><br>All better. Let's go.<br><br>How'd you learn to do that?<br><br>When my dad wouldn't lend me his car.<br><br>And that is why being a DG<br>is not in your future.<br><br>How will my life go on?<br><br>Drive!<br><br>- I don't know...<br>- Where are we going?<br><br>Oh, my God, watch out for that tree!<br><br>My goodness! My goodness!<br><br>Damn it!<br><br>Back up. There has to be another way.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>What are you waiting for, Tiff?<br>Just drive!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>Everybody out! Now!<br><br>- Get out! Get out!<br>- I can't go out there!<br><br>I can't!<br><br>Wait! Where's Jennifer?<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>- She's still inside!<br>- What?<br><br>We have to get her out! Oh, my God.<br><br>Hey, get off of there! Get off!<br><br>- Yeah, that's smart! Piss off the giant snake!<br>- Somebody help me!<br><br>Somebody help me! Someone!<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>Hey, you did everything<br>somebody like you was willing to do.<br><br>What am I going to tell my dad?<br><br>He just bought me that car!<br><br>If something happens<br>and I don't make it, do me a favor.<br><br>Kick her ass.<br><br>First on my bucket list.<br><br>- What is it?<br>- There's something out there.<br><br>It's not showing up on here.<br><br>Maybe the transmission<br>got damaged somehow.<br><br>Or maybe it's something else.<br><br>Don't shoot it. It's a federal offense.<br><br>What's it doing?<br><br>Hunting.<br><br>Hunting what?<br><br>Us.<br><br>The hell with this!<br><br>He's dead.<br><br>Let's get moving.<br>She could lay her eggs any time.<br><br>We can't just leave him here like that.<br><br>We can't take him with us.<br>He'll just slow us down.<br><br>He knew what he was signing up for.<br>He have a family?<br><br>A sister.<br><br>Send flowers. Let's go.<br><br>You do realize she's a sociopath, right?<br><br>It had crossed my mind.<br><br>Any new leads on the sorority girls?<br><br>- Space, Ferguson.<br>- No, sir... Sorry.<br><br>You guys are covered in blood.<br><br>There are only really two<br>usable beaches along the shoreline.<br><br>Everything else is just too rocky,<br>too many trees.<br><br>There's one along this path<br><br>and another one round back<br>all the way over to the other side.<br><br>That one's more popular<br>with the local teenagers.<br><br>If you, if you get my meaning.<br><br>- Show me.<br>- Okay. Yeah.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Beth!<br><br>What the hell happened here?<br><br>Bethany!<br><br>- I'm gonna go check the lake.<br>- What...<br><br>I'm just gonna...<br><br>- Ferguson! Let's go!<br>- Just gotta get my gun.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What's an abandoned boat doing here?<br><br>Ferguson, go check the boat out, okay?<br><br>We're gonna check the shoreline.<br>Let's go.<br><br>What the...<br><br>I need you to focus.<br>Okay, I'm gonna ask you again.<br><br>What happened on the boat?<br><br>Who else was on the boat with you?<br>Think.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Andrew was wakeboarding and...<br><br>Okay, but who else was there, all right?<br>I'm looking for someone. Okay?<br><br>I'm looking for a girl, 5'4", blond hair,<br>blue eyes, named Bethany.<br><br>Bethany Tull.<br><br>- Her name is Bethany!<br>- Okay, relax, Tully, okay?<br><br>I don't remember any other girls<br>on the beach!<br><br>Are you here for rush week?<br>Are you part of the sorority?<br><br>I'm looking for my daughter, damn it!<br><br>- Tully, come here!<br>- I told you I don't remember!<br><br>Take it easy, Tully.<br><br>Can't you see<br>that the girl is hysterical?<br><br>You're not gonna get anything from her,<br>not now.<br><br>- I know. I just... I'm sorry. I lost it.<br>- It's all right.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Everything will be okay. I promise.<br>I promise. It'll all be okay.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>Get her to the hospital, would you?<br>Okay?<br><br>Okay. Hey.<br><br>Hey. Now let's go find<br>your daughter, okay?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I got something.<br><br>Signal's pretty weak.<br><br>She's far.<br><br>How big is this lake?<br><br>Well, this is about as wide as she gets.<br><br>Goes down that way another click or so<br>before it hits the Clear Lake Dam.<br><br>How do we get there?<br><br>Well, let's see.<br><br>Well, we could take the roads<br>or go back over land.<br><br>There's a boat. That'll do.<br><br>I believe that's a tad too small, miss.<br><br>I'm sure you've heard that<br>more than once in your life.<br><br>I don't think that belongs to us,<br>Ms. Murdoch.<br><br>I don't care what you think.<br>Now are you coming?<br><br>Or are you giving me my money back?<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>Something crushed it like a tin can.<br><br>There's no way a crocodile<br>could do this.<br><br>You and I both know it wasn't a croc.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>I'm gonna find my daughter<br>before that snake does.<br><br>Just another day at the office.<br><br>Lower your throttle, you goon.<br>You're going too fast.<br><br>Don't listen to him. Speed up!<br><br>That's a hell of a lot of wake.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, a big wake, lots of splashing,<br><br>tends to attract crocs.<br><br>I got bigger things to worry about<br>than crocodiles, Mr. Bickerman.<br><br>Yeah. That's what you think.<br><br>What the hell was that?<br><br>We hit something.<br><br>Or something hit us.<br><br>I don't have time for this. Move!<br><br>Can you even drive a boat, lady?<br><br>What are you doing? We have to go back.<br>We have to go back.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Murdoch, you bitch!<br><br>- Help!<br>- Hey! Turn the boat around.<br><br>We got to go back and get him!<br><br>We're not going back.<br><br>You want to save him?<br>Feel free to go for a swim.<br><br>That's it. I've had it.<br>I'm taking a break.<br><br>We should just keep moving.<br><br>I don't care what you do.<br><br>I need a minute to catch my breath.<br><br>No, no, she's right.<br>We should just stop.<br><br>Let's just stand here<br>so the giant snake can catch us.<br><br>I don't think it followed us.<br><br>What we need to do<br>is find our way back to the main road.<br><br>Get your weasel ass up and keep moving.<br><br>The only way you're getting into<br>this sorority is over my dead body.<br><br>Dare to dream.<br><br>All right, girls. Two minutes.<br><br>And then we try to find the main road.<br><br>Just keep an eye out.<br><br>Crocodiles, snakes,<br><br>who knows what else<br>could be out here with us?<br><br>Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.<br><br>Brings me back to my wonderful,<br>yet nightmarish, childhood.<br><br>Anybody else hear that?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Oh, my God, something's out there.<br><br>Anyone want to bet it's not a cute,<br>little, scary-ass munchkin?<br><br>Maybe it's a search party.<br><br>Maybe they're looking for me.<br><br>Whatever it is, it's coming this way.<br><br>If it is a search party,<br>they're not leaving without me.<br><br>I didn't think there were any crocodiles<br>in Clear Lake!<br><br>Well, there's your search party.<br><br>That's not funny! What do I do?<br><br>Just don't move.<br><br>Don't move.<br><br>No! Nobody messes with a DG sister!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>- Run!<br>- Oh, my God!<br><br>- Oh, my God, run!<br>- Beth!<br><br>Dad! Dad!<br><br>Oh, my God. I thought I lost you.<br><br>I knew you'd come for me.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>I'm gonna go home and reenact that<br>to my dad and evil stepmom.<br><br>Listen, this is real sweet and all,<br>but we'd better get moving.<br><br>I can't argue with that.<br><br>- Come on, let's go. Let's go.<br>- Okay.<br><br>All right, Beach.<br><br>You've had that look on your face<br>since we got off the boat.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Nothing you need to worry about.<br><br>I'm putting my mission<br>and my life in your hands.<br><br>If you have a problem,<br>then hell yes, I need to worry.<br><br>I didn't like him any more than you did,<br>but we could've pulled him out of the water.<br><br>No one around here is gonna miss<br>Jim Bickerman, believe me.<br><br>Besides, he's probably fine.<br><br>There wasn't that much left of him.<br><br>He was a loose end.<br><br>He was right. You are a sociopath.<br><br>I'm not a sociopath, Mr. Beach.<br><br>I'm a person trying to protect<br>her father's legacy.<br><br>He spent most of his life<br>perfecting the Blood Orchid serum<br><br>and I intend to finish what he started.<br><br>Make no mistakes.<br><br>I will gladly sacrifice anyone<br>or anything that gets in my way.<br><br>Including you.<br><br>Nice to know where I stand.<br><br>Just keep doing your job<br>and you'll be fine.<br><br>This was such a gigantic mistake.<br><br>I should have pledged Omega Kappa.<br><br>How much further is it?<br><br>This is not my neck<br>of the woods, I am lost.<br><br>Relax, Tully, I know where we're going.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Sheriff, this is Ferguson. You copy?<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>Sheriff, can you hear me?<br><br>I copy, Ferguson.<br><br>Is that you?<br><br>I give up. I give up.<br><br>According to this signal,<br>she's right here somewhere.<br><br>We've been flushing them out<br>toward the choke point.<br><br>There's no way out.<br><br>I'm telling you.<br><br>She's right here.<br><br>What do you mean, right here?<br><br>The only thing I'm seeing out here<br>is you, me and Mr. Happy.<br><br>I'm telling you, she's right here.<br><br>Where is it?<br><br>- That's not her.<br>- What do you mean, that's not her?<br><br>That's the male.<br><br>Then where the hell is she?<br><br>Don't shoot it!<br><br>Damn!<br><br>You'll kill him if you shoot my snake!<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I told you I wasn't<br>gonna let you kill it,<br><br>which is what I'll do to you<br>if you get in my way.<br><br>Over there.<br><br>Don't you ever do that again.<br><br>Now, come on!<br><br>What the hell was that?<br><br>I don't know, but it's big. Let's move.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Wait a second!<br><br>We need the tracking device<br>and the case, you idiot!<br><br>And I'll take my gun back.<br><br>This is Ferguson, over.<br><br>Lot of movement down here.<br>Crocs and snakes, over.<br><br>Ferguson, where the hell are you?<br><br>I'm in a back path somewhere<br>trying to find one of the crocs.<br><br>And I think I can hear something.<br><br>Can you hear this, Ferguson?<br><br>You're hearing us.

<br><br>- I'm not putting this<br>rope around my feet.<br><br>- Take your hands away from your face.<br><br>I wanna see you.<br><br>- Please.<br><br>Please, I have a wife and I have a kid.<br><br>- You have a wife and two kids.<br><br>Awesome.<br><br>Fuck.<br><br>- Hey, mom.<br><br>How did I know it's you?<br><br>Because you're the only one who calls here<br><br>at 8 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>Yeah, mom, I'm fully aware.<br><br>Yeah, the new apartment's great.<br><br>Yeah, my boxes are unpacked.<br><br>They are!<br><br>Okay, some of them are not.<br><br>It's going really well.<br><br>Yeah, I think they're gonna<br>promote me to manager.<br><br>Well, there's a new girl and<br>they want me to train her.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Yeah, I'll tell you all about<br>it tonight, but I gotta go.<br><br>Tell the dog I said hi.<br><br>I love you too.<br><br>Mom, I gotta go.<br><br>I do, I do.<br><br>Bye, bye, bye-bye, bye, bye.<br><br>- Oh, my!<br><br>Look at that flower.<br><br>Don't we look pretty today?<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- There was a new girl looking for you.<br><br>I told her to wait for<br>you in front of room 404.<br><br>It's the first one on your list.<br><br>- I hope you're Amanda.<br><br>This place is gross.<br><br>- It's like a cigarette.<br><br>At first it's completely repulsive,<br><br>then after a while you<br>don't mind it so much.<br><br>And in the end you find yourself addicted.<br><br>Room service.<br><br>You always wanna knock first<br><br>to make sure no one's in the room.<br><br>People always forget to<br>put the tag on the door.<br><br>- Addicted?<br><br>- Yeah, to people watching.<br><br>The people who come here are total freaks.<br><br>Room service!<br><br>So the first thing you wanna<br>do is turn the lights on,<br><br>then check the bathroom<br>to make sure it's empty,<br><br>'cause, you know, sometimes<br>men hide in there.<br><br>- What do you mean?<br><br>- They wait in there for<br>the maids to come in.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>A few years ago, a girl<br>came in to make up a room,<br><br>and the bathroom door was open,<br><br>kind of like it is now,<br><br>and she reached her hand<br>in to turn on the light<br><br>without opening the door to check first,<br><br>and someone was in there.<br><br>And he grabbed her hand and hacked it off.<br><br>So, you better check to<br>make sure it's empty.<br><br>- Are you serious?<br><br>- Yeah, if you wanna survive this place,<br><br>it's the first thing you need to do<br><br>every single time you go into a room.<br><br>- I mean about the lady's hand.<br><br>- Just check the bathroom.<br><br>I'll get the curtains.<br><br>- You asshole!<br><br>That's not even funny.<br><br>- No one ever lost a hand,<br><br>but if some losers have<br>passed out in the bed,<br><br>he's definitely passed<br>out in the bathroom,<br><br>on top of the toilet or in front,<br><br>with his face in it.<br><br>I like to start from the<br>furthest corner of the room<br><br>and clean my way back to the door.<br><br>Can you pull that cart<br>in front of the door?<br><br>It keeps people from wandering in.<br><br>And make sure it's pulled inwards.<br><br>For whatever reason, people<br>really like to steal the soap.<br><br>If the comforter's still on, but wrinkled,<br><br>we don't bother changing<br>the sheets underneath.<br><br>We just straighten out what's on top.<br><br>Knock, knock.<br><br>- Who's there?<br><br>- Fidelio.<br><br>- People don't even<br>use most of this stuff,<br><br>so basically you just<br>need to straighten it up.<br><br>And then, you fold the<br>toilet paper like so,<br><br>and it gives people the<br>impression that it's a new role.<br><br>And then somehow they don't care<br><br>that it's been here<br>for the past six weeks.<br><br>Room service.<br><br>Always take the tag off the door first.<br><br>And now it's off to the next room.<br><br>- That's it?<br><br>- That's it, all day long.<br><br>Over and over and over again.<br><br>- Housekeeping.<br><br>- As gross as the people<br>who come here are,<br><br>they're pretty harmless.<br><br>Just a bunch of creeps,<br>either cheating on their wife<br><br>or paying a hooker to<br>spend some time with them.<br><br>But for the most part they<br>don't wanna be seen here,<br><br>so they pretty much keep to themselves.<br><br>- So nothing ever weird happens?<br><br>- No.<br><br>Aside from the occasional<br>fight over money,<br><br>some guy feeling like he<br>didn't get his full hour.<br><br>A lot of people just<br>try to sneak in and out.<br><br>They're really fun to watch.<br><br>- Well, it was nice meeting you.<br><br>I'll see you tomorrow?<br><br>- Tomorrow's my birthday,<br>where else would I be?<br><br>- Well, I'm gonna say happy birthday now,<br><br>just in case I wake up and forget.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- You're walking home?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well, the bus stop is just up the street.<br><br>- How far do you take it?<br><br>- Just to the other side of Jefferson.<br><br>- Hop in, I'll give you a ride.<br><br>- I don't wanna put you out.<br><br>- Don't be silly, it's<br>on the way, come on.<br><br>- You sure?<br><br>- Yeah, get in.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>You know you can call me<br>on my cellphone, right?<br><br>Minutes are unlimited<br>these days.<br><br>Well, unless you have one of<br>those pay-as-you-go phones,<br><br>and no one uses those, besides terrorists.<br><br>No, the new girl's great.<br><br>She has a car, so I hope she works out.<br><br>I'm kidding.<br><br>No.<br><br>No, I'm not kidding.<br><br>No, she gave me a ride<br>home, it was awesome.<br><br>Yeah, I didn't have to take a bus.<br><br>Sometimes there's pretty<br>creepy guys on there,<br><br>but just when it's late.<br><br>I know you worry.<br><br>Well, because that's what moms do!<br><br>Well, yeah, she's gonna<br>pick me up in the morning.<br><br>I'm on the way.<br><br>Go on, kill him!<br><br>Put down the pistol!<br><br>Do as I say, come on!<br><br>- Is that the mask that you<br>found yesterday at the motel?<br><br>You know, the motel where<br>people pay by the hour.<br><br>So were you born in New York?<br><br>- I was born in New York,<br>but I grew up in Connecticut.<br><br>Probably still be there,<br>if my dad hadn't left.<br><br>My mom just kind of lost it,<br><br>and I tried to stick<br>around as long as I could,<br><br>but she just became too much<br>to handle on a daily basis.<br><br>Shit, this is hot.<br><br>- What about you?<br><br>Are you a real New Yorker?<br><br>- Both born and raised.<br><br>Yeah, my dad checked out too,<br><br>but he checked out long<br>before he went missing.<br><br>- Went missing?<br><br>- Yeah, he was a cop when we were kids.<br><br>He'd always come home<br>and complain to my mom<br><br>about all the murderers<br>and drug dealers out there,<br><br>but they could never get anyone to talk,<br><br>SO no one ever got arrested.<br><br>They just ran wild and it drove him<br><br>and everyone he worked with crazy.<br><br>Got to the point where my<br>dad and his partner were<br><br>setting people up.<br><br>- Like hiring hitmen?<br><br>- No.<br><br>They'd catch someone with drugs,<br><br>take the drugs, take the<br>money and not arrest them.<br><br>Then send them back out in<br>the street empty handed.<br><br>And they'd find those guys two<br>days later in an alley dead.<br><br>- Well, that's one way to handle it.<br><br>- And then one day he<br>just never came home.<br><br>My mom thinks he went<br>crazy, ran off to the woods.<br><br>My brother and I think<br>he got himself killed.<br><br>- How do you usually split up the rooms?<br><br>- I'll take the odd numbers,<br>you can take the even.<br><br>That way, if you need anything,<br><br>I'll be right across the hall.<br><br>- Yeah, we do we got for a room?<br><br>409.<br><br>That one was<br>exceptionally filthy.<br><br>What's next?<br><br>- You have 409 and I have 412.<br><br>Will you shut that damn door?<br><br>- What, you gonna come in and join us,<br><br>or you're just gonna stand there?<br><br>- Leave this kid alone,<br><br>and get back to this bed.<br><br>- Did you just see that?<br><br>- Yeah, it looked like<br>you forgot to knock.<br><br>- Not funny!<br><br>What's wrong with tuna?<br><br>- When I was in fifth grade,<br>the ugliest girl in my class<br><br>inhaled tuna fish sandwiches<br>every day at lunch.<br><br>- Aw, she can't help it<br>if she was born ugly.<br><br>- She wasn't just ugly,<br>she was also an asshole.<br><br>- How could she be an<br>asshole in the fifth grade?<br><br>- When we didn't finish<br>a chapter in class,<br><br>she'd point it out to the teacher<br>and get us extra homework.<br><br>She had yellow teeth with<br>pink braces.<br><br>She was also a hall monitor.<br><br>Anyway, one day the teacher has<br>us sitting down on the floor<br><br>with her shoes off and this<br>kid starts tickling her feet,<br><br>and she starts laughing<br>and her mouth is full<br><br>of fucking tuna, all stuck in her braces,<br><br>three hours after lunch<br>at the end of the day.<br><br>The sight and smell of<br>it was so disgusting,<br><br>it turned me off to tuna<br>for the rest of my life.<br><br>- So how long have you been working here?<br><br>- It'll be a year in September.<br><br>I got three and a half years<br>through a bachelor's degree,<br><br>and then all that shit happened<br>with my dad and I left.<br><br>I think I'll have enough money<br>saved by the end of the year<br><br>to get in on the spring semester.<br><br>And then I don't have to<br>smooth out dirty sheets<br><br>and juggle condoms anymore.<br><br>- What about you?<br><br>- I like to knit.<br><br>- Cool.<br><br>- I don't have any big plans.<br><br>I mostly work here so I don't<br>have to live with my mom.<br><br>- That guy comes in every day.<br><br>I think he just jerks off<br><br>and watches porn all day.<br><br>- You should go and say hi.<br><br>You should go and say hi.<br><br>Maybe he can pay for your college tuition.<br><br>Too soon?<br><br>- You never know, I<br>might be your new boss.<br><br>I almost forgot.<br><br>I baked you a birthday cake.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>I think there's some forks inside.<br><br>- Your cake tastes like<br>something I've had before.<br><br>Really?<br><br>- Do you have any toilet paper?<br><br>- I think so, check my cart.<br><br>- I'm taking two.<br><br>Sure, just don't take it all.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>- Did you write on my list?<br><br>Write in your what?<br><br>- Nothing, I'm talking to myself.<br><br>Housekeeping.<br><br>Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here.<br><br>I knocked, no one answered.<br><br>- It's okay, I'm on my way out.<br><br>- I can come back later if you want.<br><br>- It's okay, I'm on my way out.<br><br>If you scream, I'm going to<br>cut your fucking nose off.<br><br>Do you understand?<br><br>Stand up.<br><br>Stand right here in front of me.<br><br>Go on.<br><br>Take off your clothes.<br><br>I'm only gonna ask you once.<br><br>Everything.<br><br>That's better.<br><br>That's nice.<br><br>Sing me a song.<br><br>- What kind of song?<br><br>- It doesn't matter.<br><br>Just sing.<br><br>Again, again.<br><br>You don't dance when you sing?<br><br>Start over!<br><br>You kiss your daddy with this mouth?<br><br>- My dad's dead, you asshole.<br><br>- That's sweet.<br><br>No!<br><br>- Should I stay or should I go?<br><br>- I think I just need to be<br>alone for a little while.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>But I'm gonna call you in an<br>hour and if you don't pick up,<br><br>I'm coming right back here.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>- Hey, how you doing?<br><br>- I'm okay, I guess.<br><br>I mean, it sucks, but it's<br>something someone else did to me,<br><br>so I'm not gonna let it ruin my life.<br><br>- Do you want me to come over?<br><br>- No, I think I just need to sleep.<br><br>I just can't believe they fired me.<br><br>- They fired you?!<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>When I told Dave that I<br>wasn't coming in tomorrow,<br><br>he just said it would probably be best<br><br>if I didn't come back at all.<br><br>You know, too much, like, bad publicity<br><br>for that kind of business.<br><br>Fuck him.<br><br>- Fuck him.<br><br>- He's fat, bald and obviously miserable.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>But I have some money<br>saved, so it'll be fine.<br><br>I think I'm gonna nod off.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>Well, call me if you need anything, okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>- Seriously.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>I'll talk to you soon.<br><br>Bye.<br>- Bye.<br><br>- Hi, this,<br><br>so awkward.<br><br>I saw your ad and wanted to talk.<br><br>This is about the<br>adoption, my name's Amanda.<br><br>- Hey, you.<br><br>- Hey, I did something weird.<br><br>- Okay, weird how?<br><br>- I called a lady looking to adopt.<br><br>- Okay, kind of weird.<br><br>- Yeah, she didn't answer,<br>so I just left a message.<br><br>- All right, not so weird.<br><br>Just when she calls back, don't pick up.<br><br>Problem solved.<br><br>- Yeah, but I think I wanna do this.<br><br>- I have to make a run to the post office.<br><br>I'll swing by and pick you<br>up and we can go for a ride.<br><br>- Okay, I'll be up front.<br><br>- Okay, talk to me.<br><br>Tell me what's up.<br><br>- I thought I could do this.<br><br>I thought that by having this kid,<br><br>I could make it into one<br>of those something good<br><br>comes from something<br>bad types of situation.<br><br>But the more I think about it,<br><br>the more ridiculous it sounds.<br><br>I was saving for school, 'cause<br>that was important to me,<br><br>and now I can't even pay my rent.<br><br>I mean, I was fucking raped!<br><br>The father of this kid is<br>some piece of who raped me,<br><br>someone who beat me and left me for dead.<br><br>The kind of person who puts five minutes<br><br>of their own pleasure above<br>someone else's right to live.<br><br>I mean look at my face.<br><br>- Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.<br><br>- How can I ever look at<br>a kid that was conceived<br><br>in a moment filled with<br>that much insanity,<br><br>and not be reminded of<br>it every single time?<br><br>I mean, sure, the kid is part me,<br><br>so I'll love the kid, no matter what,<br><br>but it's also part him and I<br>will always hate that part,<br><br>always, no matter what.<br><br>- Okay, do this.<br><br>Let her foster the kid.<br><br>That way, if you ever change your mind,<br><br>you can always get the kid back.<br><br>- That's her.<br><br>- I'll pull over, you can talk in the car.<br><br>- Hello.<br><br>- Hey!<br><br>Tonight's the night.<br><br>Okay, let's go<br>in and climb the fence.<br><br>Once in there, you kick.<br>- Okay.<br><br>So nice to meet you.<br><br>- Hi, nice to meet you too.<br>- Hit<br><br>I love your glasses.<br><br>- Oh, thanks.<br><br>Have a seat.<br><br>Well, I guess since I'm the one asking,<br><br>I'll tell you a little bit about myself.<br><br>It's not a very exciting story really.<br><br>Career woman, I put<br>education and earning money<br><br>ahead of settling down.<br><br>College, medical school, residency,<br><br>and then all of the effort involved<br><br>in setting up a practice,<br><br>I just didn't make time for much else.<br><br>So, here I am.<br><br>I have everything I<br>want, except for a baby.<br><br>I mean, I figured I've done<br>everything else on my own.<br><br>Why not this, right?<br><br>Oh yeah, you're right.<br><br>- You don't have to tell me anything<br><br>about yourself just yet.<br><br>I just wanted to meet you.<br><br>And you're every bit as<br>lovely as I expected.<br><br>- It's okay, it just sort<br>of happened unexpectedly.<br><br>And then I lost my job.<br><br>And this wasn't something I planned for,<br><br>so I think it'll be better<br>for everyone this way.<br><br>- You know, life can be tough.<br><br>Is everything else okay?<br><br>You know, everything else.<br><br>- I'm not sure what you mean.<br><br>- Well, you're young.<br><br>When I was your age, I liked to experiment<br><br>with different things.<br><br>Smoked a little pot, did<br>some acid in college.<br><br>Hell, maybe I did a<br>little bit more than that,<br><br>but either I'm not telling or<br>I don't remember.<br><br>Oh, let's just say I don't remember.<br><br>- That sounds like you did a lot,<br><br>if you can't remember.<br><br>I don't drink, smoke or use drugs,<br><br>so the doctor said that<br>the baby's healthy.<br><br>I didn't wanna know.<br><br>So I can't tell you if it's<br>gonna be a boy or a girl.<br><br>I could give you my doctor's number<br><br>and you can find out, if<br>you really need to know.<br><br>Maybe, but surprises can<br>be fun, right?<br><br>I have some information<br><br>that I thought you might like to see.<br><br>Just a little bit about me, my practice,<br><br>just so you know.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- Can I get this?<br><br>I'm sorry, it might be work related.<br><br>I could take it outside if you want.<br><br>- Oh, oh, no, it's okay.<br><br>I have to use the bathroom anyway.<br><br>- Dr. Gilden speaking.<br><br>- So, was she weird?<br><br>No, she was nice.<br><br>I think it's gonna be okay.<br><br>I remember when my dad used to take us<br><br>down here when we were kids.<br><br>He'd always say it was nice to sit with us<br><br>and not have to think about<br>those animals in the city.<br><br>It was a lot nicer back then.<br><br>And then he would tell<br>us that it was illegal<br><br>to swim in Central Park.<br><br>Followed by the same terrible joke.<br><br>He'd say, "How many tickles does it take<br><br>to make an octopus laugh?"<br><br>- I don't know.<br><br>- Ten-tickles.<br><br>He was so corny,<br><br>but me and my brother always laughed.<br><br>- Here.<br><br>- What's this?<br><br>- Open it.<br><br>I was gonna give it to you after.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- You're welcome.<br><br>Wait, one more.<br><br>Oh my God!<br><br>Did you make these?<br><br>Oh my God!<br><br>You are an old lady!<br><br>- Shut up!<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>Really, really, thank you for this.<br><br>- You're welcome.<br><br>Call me later, okay?<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>Wait, wait!<br><br>I almost forgot this stuff.<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>- Hi.<br><br>I didn't mean to startle you.<br><br>I just had to leave so abruptly earlier,<br><br>I didn't want you to<br>think I was being rude.<br><br>- Oh no, I just assumed that you get<br><br>pretty busy during the day.<br><br>- I've read about this.<br><br>You know, I always wanted<br>to write a children's book.<br><br>If I didn't go to med school,<br><br>I could have been a children's author.<br><br>- How did you know where I live?<br><br>- Oh, I just looked your address up.<br><br>Hope you don't think<br>I'm being too forward.<br><br>You know, it turns out that my secretary<br><br>used to work for your obstetrician.<br><br>- You can come inside if you'd like.<br><br>Yeah, it was weird.<br><br>She was just standing outside<br>when I got to my front door.<br><br>I don't know if she's just being polite<br><br>about skipping out on lunch<br>and it freaked me out,<br><br>'cause no one's polite anymore.<br><br>- Or maybe she wants to<br>Kill you and take your baby.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>- Is that it?<br><br>- Can you actually grab<br>me a jar of pickles?<br><br>- I knew this girl.<br><br>She craved vinegar when she was pregnant.<br><br>At first it was vinegar on her salad,<br><br>then it was vinegar-flavored,<br>potato chips,<br><br>then it was salt and vinegar popcorn.<br><br>Eventually she just started drinking it<br><br>straight out of the bottle.<br><br>Her baby was born<br>premature, had a clubfoot.<br><br>So sad.<br><br>It was probably dehydration.<br><br>Vinegar can dehydrate you.<br><br>- I'll be careful.<br><br>- I know who you are.<br><br>It isn't necessary.<br><br>Dr. Gilden said to bill it to her account.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Fine, call me back when<br>you get your shit together,<br><br>whoever this is.<br><br>I only wanted you to make him talk<br><br>before you killed him.<br><br>That's what we were trying to do,<br><br>so I got to find out who killed my father.<br><br>And I still don't know!<br><br>You ain't too smart, Marshall.<br><br>- Don't you know what a good shot I am?<br><br>That was you who told the judge<br><br>you definitely saw me kill man.<br><br>- Hello?<br><br>- Hi, it's Catherine.<br><br>I got my shit together.<br><br>Oh my God.<br><br>You probably think I'm such<br>a bitch, I swear I'm not.<br><br>- Oh, don't be silly.<br><br>I was going through a<br>tunnel, we lost reception.<br><br>Anyway, I didn't get a<br>chance to speak to you<br><br>before you left the grocery store.<br><br>- Oh, sorry, I didn't know that was you.<br><br>I was expecting a package<br>and I wanted to make sure<br><br>I was here when the mailman came,<br><br>so I pretty much rushed back.<br><br>- Well, I just wanted to let you know<br><br>that I have an account<br>at the grocery store,<br><br>so if you need anything, just get it,<br><br>and tell them to bill me, okay?<br><br>- Oh, that's sweet.<br><br>Sorry, that's the doorbell, I gotta run.<br><br>- You better run.<br><br>Could be the delivery man.<br><br>Let's talk later.<br><br>- Definitely, talk soon.<br><br>Order 261,<br>I have one curly fry,<br><br>three plain, two small Cokes.<br>- Yes, that's me.<br><br>- There you go, have a great day.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Here you go.<br><br>- I feel so fat, I hate it.<br><br>- Well, you are eating like a wild boar.<br><br>- Do boars even eat that much?<br><br>- They're pigs.<br><br>Or maybe you're having twins.<br><br>- Okay, that's not even funny.<br><br>- It's pretty funny.<br><br>There's this one lady that had twins,<br><br>something like 87 days apart.<br><br>- Is that even possible?<br><br>- Apparently.<br><br>She gave birth to one kid,<br><br>and then three months<br>later had another one.<br><br>Twins.<br><br>87 days apart.<br><br>- Fuck.<br><br>- I swear.<br><br>I think it happened in London.<br><br>Or was it Ireland?<br><br>- So, something weird happened yesterday.<br><br>I'm at the grocery store and<br>the lady at the cash register,<br><br>she wouldn't take my money.<br><br>- Go on.<br><br>- She tells me that Dr. Gilden told her<br><br>to put my groceries on her tab.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>- They know me there.<br><br>That's weird.<br><br>- Who's Dr. Gilden?<br><br>- Really? The woman who<br>wants to adopt this baby.<br><br>Are you even listening?<br><br>- You're right, that's weird.<br><br>- Yeah, that's really fucking weird.<br><br>- Maybe she just wants to make<br>sure you're eating healthy.<br><br>She's a doctor after all.<br><br>- That's strike two.<br><br>- Strike two? Was there a strike one?<br><br>- Yeah, first that bitch<br>looked up my address<br><br>and just showed up at my door<br>after skipping out on lunch.<br><br>- Okay, strike one for sure.<br><br>- Now she's following<br>me to the grocery store<br><br>and spying on me while I shop?<br><br>Then insulting me by insinuating<br><br>that I can't pay for my own groceries,<br><br>asking me if everything's okay,<br><br>as if I look like some fucking crack head.<br><br>Fuck that!<br><br>- Okay, strike two, but<br>take the free groceries.<br><br>You know, if she keeps<br>acting like a weirdo,<br><br>this isn't gonna work out.<br><br>I would rather live with<br>a baby in a dumpster<br><br>than give her to some psycho stalker.<br><br>- Her?<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>- You just referred to the baby as her.<br><br>- I did?<br><br>- Yeah, you did.<br><br>- I asked the doctor the<br>other day after lunch.<br><br>I don't know, I guess<br>the stress of everything,<br><br>it was really getting to me.<br><br>And I had to know something.<br><br>It's a girl.<br><br>- Is this strike three?<br><br>- That bitch!<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>- I was just checking in to<br>make sure everything was okay.<br><br>- Well, it's not your<br>job to check in on me.<br><br>Is that my mail?<br><br>- Oh, yeah, the mail man gave it to me.<br><br>He thought I was your mother.<br><br>- Can I have my mail, please?<br><br>- Imagine that, your mother.<br><br>I mean, your sister, I could-<br><br>- Please leave, this<br>was a really bad idea.<br><br>What don't you understand about<br>get the fuck away from me?<br><br>- I really think you should go,<br><br>she seems really upset.<br><br>- Let go of my fucking arm!<br><br>- Where are you going?<br><br>- That stupid bitch opened my mail.<br><br>- Let it go, that woman is crazy,<br><br>and like you're gonna fight anyone anyway.<br><br>You're a million months pregnant<br><br>and your stomach is about to explode.<br><br>- How fucking weird is that?<br><br>- Okay, that was weird, I<br>totally get what you mean now.<br><br>- Who opens other people's mail?<br><br>I mean, who the fuck does that?<br><br>She doesn't even know me!<br><br>Do I call her and tell her to fuck off?<br><br>- I think you already sent that message.<br><br>- Well, do I call the police?<br><br>- Let's not agitate her,<br>this woman is clearly rabbed,<br><br>we don't know what'll send her off.<br><br>- Hi, I'm trying to reach Doctor Gilden.<br><br>The two of you need to take at least a day<br><br>before you even consider<br>talking to each other.<br><br>- I'm sorry, what?<br><br>- My dad has a place in<br>hours on north of here,<br><br>where we can go for a couple of days-<br><br>- She's not even a doctor.<br><br>- What?<br>- I just called her office<br><br>and she's not even a fucking doctor.<br><br>- It's Friday, I can take<br>Monday off from work.<br><br>- I'm gonna throw up, oh my God.<br><br>- And we can stop and get<br>some snacks along the way.<br><br>- What about this?<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>- What about this?<br><br>- Just get whatever.<br><br>Get two of everything if you want.<br><br>- Sorry.<br><br>- It's 98,50.<br><br>- Charge everything to Catherine<br>Gilden's account, please.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>- Here we are.<br><br>In the finest outdated cottage<br><br>half a divorce settlement can buy.<br><br>- Are you sure your dad's not gonna mind?<br><br>- It's fine.<br><br>He hasn't been here since Christmas,<br><br>three years ago.<br><br>Hopefully he remembered<br>to turn off the water.<br><br>If he didn't and the pipes<br>froze or broke or whatever,<br><br>we're gonna have to<br>find a lake to bathe in.<br><br>- Yeah, that's all someone needs,<br><br>to stumble upon a naked pregnant<br>woman bathing in a lake.<br><br>- Go inside, I'm gonna get<br>the stuff from the car.<br><br>- Are you sure? I don't mind helping.<br><br>- Here, now go inside and sit down.<br><br>I don't remember which key it is,<br><br>so you're gonna have to try 'em all.<br><br>Oh, good, someone did turn the water off.<br><br>I'm gonna go get the rest<br>of the stuff from the car.<br><br>- Let me help.<br><br>I can't just sit inside<br>while you're out here<br><br>doing everything.<br><br>You've done so much for me as it is.<br><br>Called my mom to tell her we were up here.<br><br>She didn't fucking answer.<br><br>- Give me my fucking baby!<br><br>I'm calling the police,<br>you fucking psycho!<br><br>- You are not gonna take my baby from me.<br><br>- It's not your baby, you asshole!<br><br>- Nobody's gonna take my baby.<br><br>Nobody's gonna take my baby!<br><br>Nobody's gonna take my baby!<br><br>Nobody's gonna take my baby.<br><br>Nobody's gonna take my baby!<br><br>Nobody's gonna take my baby!<br><br>- Fuck you!<br><br>Fuck you!<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Fuck!<br><br>How is this my life?<br><br>- I told you nobody<br>was gonna take my baby.<br><br>That's my baby.<br><br>You ungrateful little bitch.<br><br>Give me my baby!<br><br>You ungrateful little bitch!<br><br>We had an agreement.<br><br>That baby is mine!<br><br>That baby is mine!<br><br>Give me that baby!<br><br>Nobody's gonna my baby.<br><br>She's my baby!<br><br>She's mine, you know<br>she's mine, you told me!<br><br>Little bitch!<br><br>Give me that baby.<br><br>Give me my baby!<br><br>- Give me my baby!<br><br>Where's my baby?<br><br>- It's my baby.<br><br>And it's dead.<br><br>- Where's my baby?<br><br>- Your baby's dead!<br><br>- What are you saying?<br><br>- I'm saying that it's not alive anymore.<br><br>I killed it.<br><br>It's dead.<br><br>- You ungrateful beast!<br><br>After all I did for you.<br><br>- After all I did for that baby!<br><br>After all you've done for me?<br><br>After all you've done for my baby?<br><br>What did you do besides<br>make my life more miserable<br><br>than it already was, you<br>fucking psycho stalker?<br><br>Go ahead, kill me.<br><br>Kill me!<br><br>Fucking kill me, I don't care anymore!<br><br>Where's my fucking baby?<br><br>I hear her crying.<br><br>She needs her mother.<br><br>Where's my baby?<br><br>- Why won't you fucking die?<br><br>- You need some help with that?<br><br>- It's okay, I got it.<br><br>I think I better help you.<br><br>- Take your hands away from your face.<br><br>I wanna see you.<br><br>- Please.<br><br>Please, I have a wife and I have a kid.<br><br>- You have a wife and two kids.<br><br>No.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>No, no, no!<br><br>What are you doing to me?</div>

I'm so touched.<br><br>Min-su, you see, staying single<br>isn't such a bad thing at all.<br><br>What?<br><br>Just saying.<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>Anyway, all right. Good luck.<br><br>I can do this.<br><br>Hey, babe. I'm here.<br><br>Min-su, why are you all dressed up today?<br><br>Huh? Oh, just because.<br><br>I didn't have lunch, so<br>I'm starving right now.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>- Babe, but I was just wondering...<br>- What?<br><br>Can we chat for a minute before we order?<br><br>I need to eat. I'm getting heartburn.<br><br>Okay, I'll make it quick.<br><br>All right.<br><br>"Dearest Seong-gyeong."<br><br>"Hi, my love."<br><br>"Coincidence brought us together<br>while we were traveling in Taiwan."<br><br>"And we fell in love."<br><br>"Today, we celebrate the 1,000th day<br>of our relationship."<br><br>Is it our 1,000th-day anniversary?<br><br>It is.<br><br>My gosh, I had no idea.<br><br>Babe, I'm sorry,<br><br>but can you just let<br>me finish reading this?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>"Whenever I look into your eyes,"<br><br>"I'm so grateful that the woman<br>with the warmest and loveliest soul"<br><br>"in the whole wide world<br>is right by my side."<br><br>"I'm very timid and sensitive."<br><br>"I'm not really good at anything<br>and have a lot to learn."<br><br>"But I want to become..."<br><br>"the most amazing man<br>in the world for you."<br><br>"So I'm going to work harder<br>to become a better man for you."<br><br>"I want to make you happy<br>for the rest of your life."<br><br>"That's my dream."<br><br>Seong-gyeong.<br><br>Will you marry me?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>Go all the way. Nine.<br><br>This is the last one. You can do it.<br>Slowly.<br><br>I'm sorry. The sales numbers<br>were unusually low this month.<br><br>I'll send you 1,500 dollars first.<br><br>I'm sorry, Uncle.<br><br>Oh, no. It's not too bad.<br><br>The industry changed quite a bit<br>while I was running the café.<br><br>I'm learning and adjusting.<br><br>Yes, of course.<br><br>All right, take care.<br><br>Oh, no.<br><br>Darn it!<br><br>I'm broke right now! Come on!<br><br>Hi there. Do you think you can lose weight<br>by going that slow?<br><br>I don't think so.<br><br>Whoa, don't do that. You'll hurt yourself.<br><br>You're trying to lose weight, right?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>But why?<br><br>I want to impress my girlfriend.<br><br>You're probably younger than me,<br>so I'll drop the honorifics.<br><br>What's your name?<br><br>Lee Byung-hun.<br><br>Byung-hun, I'll let you in on a secret.<br><br>You see, I weighed 90kg<br>when I was in 12th grade.<br><br>- Really?<br>- Yes! Do you know how I lost weight?<br><br>How?<br><br>I can't explain how I did it<br>without showing you.<br><br>Book 100 personal<br>training sessions with me.<br><br>Then I'll make sure you lose 20kg.<br><br>- 20kg?<br>- Yes!<br><br>I believe experience is the best teacher.<br><br>I can teach you because<br>I've done it myself.<br><br>You can do anything to lose 20kg, right?<br><br>Yes, I can do anything.<br><br>Great. Let's do this!<br><br>Okay! But I have to get<br>my mom's permission.<br><br>- Your mom?<br>- Yes.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Yes, there are many<br>great fitness channels on YouTube.<br><br>But those trainers on YouTube<br>don't exactly know about Byung-hun.<br><br>Because they've never met him.<br><br>But so many people watch<br>those videos to train.<br><br>Ma'am, what if he overexerts himself<br>while following those routines<br><br>and ends up with a herniated disk?<br><br>No! That'd be horrible.<br><br>Exactly! A good personal<br>trainer is like a tailor.<br><br>I'll design a workout routine<br>that's perfectly customized for Byung-hun.<br><br>Working out with me will improve<br>his concentration and boost his confidence.<br><br>It will also help him a lot in his studies.<br><br>How much will it cost though?<br><br>Money is important,<br><br>but I care a lot more<br>about my clients and their health.<br><br>If you stop by this evening,<br>I'll give you a discount.<br><br>Then can I stop by at nine?<br><br>This is so pretty.<br><br>Babe, I haven't talked<br>to you about this yet,<br><br>but I've been thinking about<br>where we should live after we get married.<br><br>And the conclusion is...<br><br>Let's sign a lump-sum lease<br>for an apartment near Gimpo Airport.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yes. I know how tired you<br>get after each flight.<br><br>You have a job that is<br>emotionally and physically taxing.<br><br>I always felt bad about it.<br><br>I want to live near the airport<br>to make things easier for you.<br><br>My gosh, I'm so touched.<br><br>But isn't that area pretty expensive?<br><br>There's something I haven't told you yet.<br><br>When my mother passed away,<br><br>I inherited a small house<br>that was under her name.<br><br>If I sell that house and use my savings,<br><br>I should be able to pay the deposit<br>without taking out a loan.<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>Why didn't you tell me about that house?<br><br>Well...<br><br>If you used to live there with your mother,<br><br>why did you move out?<br><br>Well, the house is old.<br><br>So the heating doesn't work properly.<br><br>And there's no subway station nearby.<br><br>Where is it?<br><br>I'd say it's about a<br>15-minute walk from my place?<br><br>Min-su.<br><br>I thought we knew<br>everything about each other.<br><br>But you kept such an<br>important thing from me.<br><br>It hurts my feelings a little.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>I just realized that<br>there's something I never told you.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>"JUNG SEONG-GYEONG"<br><br>What is this?<br><br>My allergy medication.<br><br>My entire family is allergic to dog saliva.<br><br>When I come in contact with dog saliva,<br><br>my throat swells up to the point<br>that I can't breathe.<br><br>So you had to take this<br>every time we met up?<br><br>Only when Runie was there.<br><br>You said Runie helped you find solace<br><br>after your mother passed away.<br><br>Runie is your family, so I didn't<br>want you to worry about my allergy.<br><br>But if we get married and<br>start living together...<br><br>I can't take those pills every day.<br><br>We'll have a baby someday, you know.<br><br>Babe.<br><br>Don't worry.<br><br>Everyone in my family loves Runie.<br><br>If I ask them, they'll<br>be happy to take him.<br><br>Are you sure they'll be okay with it?<br><br>Yes, they take care of him for me<br>from time to time anyway.<br><br>Babe, I'll make sure...<br><br>you won't have to take this again.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Is it not possible to<br>get rid of the allergy?<br><br>Dog saliva has a few types of<br>proteins that can cause allergies.<br><br>But they can't be cured since<br>allergies are hereditary.<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>There's a simple solution.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Don't get married.<br><br>I'm serious right now.<br><br>Goodness. Okay, all right.<br><br>Min-su, don't worry.<br><br>You have me.<br><br>I'll help you.<br><br>But who in the family can look after Runie?<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Our second aunt won't be able to take him<br>since her husband recently quit his job.<br><br>And our youngest aunt is out of the<br>question because Ji-ho is taking the CSAT.<br><br>What about Uncle?<br><br>Has he looked after Runie before?<br><br>He hasn't?<br><br>No! Aunt was bitten by a dog once,<br>so she's afraid of big dogs.<br><br>Runie never bites people.<br><br>Come on! That's what you think.<br><br>When you're traumatized<br>by an experience like that,<br><br>even seeing something similar<br>makes you freeze instinctively.<br><br>Hey, is there a reason<br>it has to be someone in the family?<br><br>Because I won't be able<br>to trust the person otherwise.<br><br>It doesn't have to be a family member.<br>You can find a good person you can trust.<br><br>But how?<br><br>Post on Instagram that you're looking<br>for someone to adopt Runie.<br><br>On Instagram?<br><br>Many people do that these days.<br><br>But I can't use my account because<br>Seong-gyeong follows me on Instagram.<br><br>I told her someone in the family<br>would be happy to take Runie.<br><br>Hey, you're on Instagram?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Why didn't you tell me?<br><br>You never asked.<br><br>Whatever. How many followers do you have?<br><br>My follower count has probably gone up.<br><br>Let's see. 30 followers.<br><br>Gosh! Are you serious?<br>You've got to be kidding me.<br><br>- That's like nothing.<br>- Huh?<br><br>What? How many do you have?<br><br>Hey, I have 30,000 followers.<br><br>No way.<br><br>Gosh, you have practically no followers.<br><br>"KIM JIN-GUK / 31K FOLLOWERS"<br>My gosh.<br><br>But you're old.<br>How do you have 30,000 followers?<br><br>Hey, I'm not old! I was born in 1978.<br><br>My life's just beginning now.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Look at all these wrinkles here.<br><br>- How will you begin your life...<br>- Why you little!<br><br>- Jeez, seriously.<br>- Okay, fine.<br><br>But can you really trust someone<br>you met on Instagram?<br><br>I'm sure some are trustworthy,<br>and some are not.<br><br>Talk to them in person and find out.<br><br>You never know.<br><br>When do you need to rehome Runie by?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I'm not even sure if it's<br>the right thing to do.<br><br>It's just a matter of<br>finding the right person.<br><br>If you find someone who will<br>love Runie as much as you do,<br><br>you won't feel so bad about it.<br><br>Hey, let's just take one step at a time.<br><br>Let's post on my Instagram<br><br>and see if we can find someone<br>who wants to adopt Runie.<br><br>You can rehome him<br>if you find someone you really like.<br><br>If that doesn't happen,<br>we'll look for another solution.<br><br>We have no idea how long it would take,<br>so let's start soon.<br><br>Okay, I think that's a good plan.<br><br>Then how much will you pay me for the ad?<br><br>- "Ad"?<br>- Hey, think about it.<br><br>I have 30,000 followers.<br><br>When an influencer like me<br>puts on an advertisement,<br><br>it's obvious I need to<br>be compensated for it.<br><br>When did you become such a jerk?<br><br>Why are you calling me a jerk?<br><br>So many companies DM me for ad inquiries.<br><br>Come on. You only have<br>30,000 followers, not 300,000.<br><br>No way.<br><br>It's not like I'm asking for a huge sum.<br><br>Hey, I'm dirt broke right now,<br><br>and my screen is all cracked.<br><br>When I'm on the phone,<br>the shards dig into my skin.<br><br>I'm asking you to help me get this<br>replaced, and you call me a jerk?<br><br>Quiet down.<br><br>Whatever! I don't care. Just help me out!<br><br>You're that broke?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Okay, fine.<br><br>If you find someone who'll adopt Runie,<br>I'll get you a new screen.<br><br>I'll do my best, sir.<br><br>Bow to me politely.<br><br>I'm sorry I got home so late.<br><br>If I can't find someone<br>who will think of you as their family,<br><br>I won't send you anywhere, so don't worry.<br><br>I promise.<br><br>My phone's blowing up.<br><br>Being an influencer sure isn't easy.<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Who's this?<br><br>"HELLO! IT'S ME, PARK MI-SUN!"<br><br>Oh, it's Mi-sun. I<br>trained her a while back.<br><br>Her husband is good-looking.<br><br>Right? He's very handsome.<br><br>I know. He kind of looks like me<br>when I was younger.<br><br>Who does the baby take after?<br><br>He just fell asleep.<br><br>- Thank you for coming.<br>- Of course.<br><br>No problem at all.<br><br>Let me explain our situation.<br><br>I read in a book<br>that kids who grow up with dogs<br><br>have stronger immune systems<br>and tend to be a lot more sociable.<br><br>My husband and I have decided<br>to have only one kid.<br><br>So we kept wondering if we should get a dog<br>to make sure our kid wouldn't feel lonely.<br><br>Then I saw your post on Instagram.<br><br>- Runie, right?<br>- Yes.<br><br>He's so cute!<br><br>"PARK SEONG-JIN"<br><br>Why is this person calling me?<br><br>You must put your phone on vibrate<br>in theaters and around babies.<br><br>You have no manners.<br><br>You'll never become an agent of Kingsman.<br><br>"Kingsman"? That's so random.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>It's okay. No worries.<br><br>Why don't we sit closer?<br><br>Because of my baby.<br><br>Is anyone in your family allergic to dogs?<br><br>Dog saliva has a few types of proteins<br>that can cause allergies.<br><br>If you were born allergic to dogs,<br>it can't be cured.<br><br>Don't worry. Once, a friend of mine<br>brought her dog to our place,<br><br>and the baby was fine.<br><br>- I'm glad to hear that.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>It seems like you both<br>think it'll work out,<br><br>so why don't we meet Runie together?<br><br>- Sounds good!<br>- Great.<br><br>Then let's...<br><br>Darn it.<br><br>Turn off the barking!<br><br>"ORDER RUNIE'S FOOD" Darn it.<br><br>I'm sorry, baby.<br><br>You'll never become a<br>Kingsman agent either.<br><br>- Hey, did you not eat breakfast?<br>- Why?<br><br>Your breath smells like poop.<br><br>Only jerks attack others' weaknesses.<br><br>Quiet!<br><br>Can you both put your<br>phones on silent mode?<br><br>So when can I meet Runie?<br><br>If you have some time today...<br><br>Where are your manners?<br><br>Enough is enough!<br><br>Sorry to interrupt<br>while you're letting out your anger.<br><br>You'd better be.<br><br>Looks like your mother-in-law<br>needs to speak to you.<br><br>"MOTHER-IN-LAW"<br><br>Let's talk another time.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Hey, let's go.<br><br>Put on the guest slippers.<br><br>Oh, sure.<br><br>Getting a golden retriever<br>has always been my dream.<br><br>Overseas, you see cool people<br>walking their golden retrievers.<br><br>I wanted to become successful<br>and go for walks with my golden retriever.<br><br>I have a company that sells chicken breasts,<br>and it finally made it big last year.<br><br>Well, not that big. Our last year's revenue<br>was over 8 million dollars.<br><br>- This is my living room.<br>- Whoa.<br><br>Wow, look at that!<br><br>It's just a humble abode,<br>perfect for a single guy.<br><br>- Hey, you must've hit the jackpot!<br>- Gosh, no.<br><br>No, wait!<br><br>Hold on a second.<br><br>What's he doing?<br><br>Don't move.<br><br>What's wrong? What is it?<br><br>I'm a bit of a neat freak.<br><br>Gosh, you're covered in dog hair.<br><br>You know that<br>golden retrievers shed a lot, right?<br><br>Really?<br><br>Especially during shedding seasons.<br><br>One touch, and your hand will be covered.<br><br>Will you be okay with that?<br><br>Is there a golden retriever<br>that doesn't shed?<br><br>Have you seen a short-necked giraffe?<br><br>Come on. How can a<br>giraffe have a short neck?<br><br>I'm trying to tell you that<br>all golden retrievers shed.<br><br>Oh, I see.<br><br>But I don't appreciate<br>the way you just said it.<br><br>Then shall I be more direct?<br><br>Yeah, be direct.<br><br>A dog isn't a decorative object.<br><br>Don't get a dog until you're<br>ready to truly love it.<br><br>Hey...<br><br>I'll see you another time.<br><br>Are you sure we can find someone this way?<br><br>It's because they've never<br>had a dog in their lives.<br><br>The person we'll meet<br>next used to have a dog.<br><br>A golden retriever, just like Runie.<br><br>Really? Who is this person?<br><br>One of the regulars at my old café.<br><br>The thing is though, his<br>dog died from cancer.<br><br>Sang-ho.<br><br>Sang-ho?<br><br>Hey, pass me your phone for a sec.<br>I want to show you something.<br><br>You have your phone.<br><br>The glass dust will get on my fingers.<br>Just hand it over.<br><br>- Don't go through my albums.<br>- Why would I go through your photos?<br><br>Here.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>These dogs look so happy.<br>Their tails are perked up.<br><br>The under-eye area looks so clean.<br><br>Looks like the owner<br>takes great care of them.<br><br>Do you know this person?<br><br>No. I couldn't fall asleep last night.<br><br>So I was browsing on Instagram,<br>and this account popped up.<br><br>But this person lives in Jeju Island.<br><br>That's too far.<br><br>Gosh, I'm sorry.<br>I don't think he'll come down.<br><br>He's going through puberty,<br>so he's on edge these days.<br><br>No worries. We understand.<br><br>When did your dog pass away?<br><br>It's already been over a month.<br><br>But he's having a hard time accepting it.<br><br>I get it though.<br><br>We adopted him from a shelter<br>when Sang-ho was four<br><br>and lived with him for ten years.<br><br>My gosh, no wonder he's<br>still so devastated.<br><br>I thought adopting a similar dog<br>would help him, so I brought it up,<br><br>but he got so upset with me.<br><br>Then I happened to see<br>your post on Instagram.<br><br>He was a regular at my old café.<br><br>Oh, really?<br><br>I love the pour-over<br>coffee that Jin-guk makes.<br><br>I make great pour-over coffee.<br><br>What?<br><br>Anyway,<br><br>I was so surprised when I saw that post.<br><br>Min-su, our dogs almost look identical.<br><br>- My gosh!<br>- I do see a bit of resemblance.<br><br>Not just a bit.<br><br>They look like twins.<br><br>See this part where the hair has<br>turned white? Even that's identical.<br><br>Min-su, how about you go upstairs<br><br>and talk to Sang-ho about it?<br><br>You love dogs and have had Runie for years,<br><br>so I'm sure the two of you<br>can relate to each other.<br><br>Oh, good point.<br><br>Shall I try?<br><br>Yes, you should.<br><br>All right. I'll go see<br>if I can talk to him.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- I'll be right back.<br><br>Dad, leave me alone!<br><br>Hi, Sang-ho. My name is Min-su.<br><br>I'm your dad's acquaintance.<br>Can I come in for a minute?<br><br>Why do you need to come in?<br><br>I have a golden retriever, too.<br>His name is Runie.<br><br>What's your dog's name?<br><br>Jung-ho.<br><br>I see, Jung-ho.<br><br>That sounds like a person's name.<br><br>Did you come up with the name?<br><br>Yes, both our names end with "Ho".<br><br>Because he's my little brother.<br><br>I see. I guess you have no siblings.<br><br>Not anymore.<br><br>I'm an only child too.<br><br>So I was very lonely as well<br>when I was growing up.<br><br>You were probably not lonely at all<br>when Jung-ho was around.<br><br>Right.<br><br>I know what it's like.<br><br>But you see, Sang-ho...<br><br>I heard all dogs go to heaven.<br><br>I'm sure Jung-ho is in heaven now,<br>watching over you even at this very moment.<br><br>So if you're this devastated,<br><br>Jung-ho will be very sad, don't you think?<br><br>He'd want to console<br>you right by your side,<br><br>but he can't do that now.<br><br>You don't want Jung-ho to be sad, right?<br><br>I don't want him to be sad.<br><br>Sang-ho.<br><br>I want to show you something.<br>Can I come in for a minute?<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Oh, here. This is my dog.<br><br>Jung-ho!<br><br>It's not Jung-ho. He's my dog, Runie.<br><br>What the hell are you talking about?<br><br>Oh, I mean... He's not Sang-ho.<br><br>What I'm saying is, he's not Jung-ho.<br><br>No! This is my dog.<br><br>Sang-ho, this is my dog, Runie.<br><br>No, this is Jung-ho. It's my dog.<br><br>No, he's my dog.<br><br>He's my dog!<br><br>Runie is my dog, you little brat!<br><br>Jung-ho is my dog, you little brat!<br><br>- He's my dog.<br>- I said, he's mine!<br><br>- He's my dog.<br>- No, he's my dog.<br><br>- He's mine!<br>- No, he's mine!<br><br>- No, he's mine.<br>- My dog!<br><br>- No!<br>- No!<br><br>He's my dog!<br><br>Who's this?<br><br>My son. He's learning special martial arts.<br><br>That's very cool.<br><br>He's really good.<br><br>Don't say anything, mister.<br><br>Just don't.<br><br>I mean it. Don't!<br><br>I will kill you!<br><br>He is my dog!<br><br>You little...<br><br>I'm much older than you... Gosh!<br><br>- That doesn't matter.<br>- It went everywhere. My wife...<br><br>- Sang-ho.<br>- Get him out of there.<br><br>What's he talking about?<br><br>Huh? Hey! What happened...<br><br>Gosh, I get that he's tired,<br>but how could he fall asleep here?<br><br>Hey, I told you to persuade the kid.<br>Why are you sleeping here?<br><br>My dog...<br><br>I thought you were sleeping.<br><br>I'm not crazy. Why would I<br>fall asleep in a stranger's house?<br><br>Right, you're not that crazy.<br><br>Anyway, what do you think?<br>Aren't they the best candidate?<br><br>I'm not sure.<br><br>They live close to you,<br>and they used to have a golden retriever.<br><br>There are different levels of compatibility<br>between dogs and their owners.<br><br>I don't think they're compatible.<br><br>- Why not?<br>- Think about it.<br><br>Sang-ho will expect Runie<br>to act exactly like Jung-ho.<br><br>But Runie is Runie. He's not Jung-ho.<br><br>Runie has his own likes and dislikes,<br><br>but Sang-ho won't understand that.<br><br>Then Runie and Jung-ho...<br><br>I mean, neither Runie nor<br>Sang-ho will be happy.<br><br>Hey, didn't you say<br>you put this place up for sale?<br><br>Yeah, but it hasn't sold yet,<br>so I'm still waiting on it.<br><br>But that window is open.<br><br>Hey, it's so dusty in here.<br><br>I'll go upstairs quickly<br>and close the window.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>Mom...<br><br>Mom, wait.<br><br>Just a moment.<br><br>Mom, please... Just a moment.<br><br>Mom, no...<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Runie...<br><br>Runie...<br><br>Runie.<br><br>I didn't even get to say goodbye to Mom.<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>Runie...<br><br>After I graduated from college,<br><br>I wanted to win the literary contest<br>and become a novelist.<br><br>I wasn't even earning a single penny,<br><br>but I whined to my mom every day<br>about how stressed out I was.<br><br>I did that for four years.<br><br>All the stress I had caused her...<br><br>became cancer cells...<br><br>and killed her.<br><br>So I told myself...<br><br>that I would never cause<br>pain to those I love again.<br><br>But Seong-gyeong...<br><br>She has been taking<br>medication because of me.<br><br>I had no idea.<br><br>I'm a worthless jerk.<br><br>- Gosh, what a moron.<br>- Hey.<br><br>Hey, you'll hurt yourself. Don't do that.<br><br>Hey, stop it.<br><br>- I should just die!<br>- Min-su.<br><br>Min-su! Hey.<br><br>I'll make sure we find<br>a good new home for Runie,<br><br>and you and Seong-gyeong will<br>get married without any problems.<br><br>So don't cry.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Why are you crying again?<br><br>- My eyes are burning.<br>- What?<br><br>My eyes are burning!<br><br>I can't see anything!<br><br>Excuse me!<br><br>Can we get a clean towelette over here?<br><br>Bye, take care.<br><br>- Get home safely.<br>- Bye!<br><br>- Will do.<br>- Bye.<br><br>- Ouch!<br>- Sorry! I'm sorry, Min-su.<br><br>- I'm heavy, aren't I?<br>- No, not at all.<br><br>I gave you a piggyback ride<br>every day when you were little.<br><br>- How about now?<br>- Hey! Stop kicking.<br><br>Keep your legs still, you brat.<br><br>This isn't because you're heavy.<br><br>It's because I'm drunk now.<br>That's why, okay?<br><br>"MY PUPPY"<br><br>Sorry, I just woke up.<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>I have a headache.<br><br>Do you remember calling me last night<br><br>crying and saying sorry over and over?<br><br>I'm sorry. I drank way too much<br>with Jin-guk last night.<br><br>That's okay.<br><br>But I want you to tell me whenever<br>you're stressed out about something.<br><br>We'll become a family soon, you know.<br><br>A family must overcome<br>challenges and hardships together.<br><br>Don't take it all on yourself.<br><br>Okay, I won't.<br><br>I have to head in now.<br><br>I'll call you when I arrive.<br><br>Okay. Love you, babe.<br><br>Love you more.<br><br>My second uncle lives in Paju,<br>and he has a small garden.<br><br>Right.<br><br>A black dog named Rey lives in that garden.<br><br>That dog kind of looks like Runie,<br><br>but it's a bit smaller<br>and has shorter hair.<br><br>Oh, it must be a Labrador retriever.<br><br>Labrador... I see.<br><br>This is good. You don't want coffee?<br><br>I'm not a fan of these beans.<br><br>Hey, do you think Runie and Rey<br>can become friends?<br><br>Every dog has a different personality.<br><br>So it's hard to tell unless they meet.<br><br>But I have to say, Paju is pretty far.<br><br>I know. But clearly,<br>there are advantages to this option.<br><br>First, he's an experienced retriever owner.<br><br>And Runie and his dog may become friends.<br><br>The pros might outweigh the cons.<br><br>Let's go and see.<br><br>Good boy.<br><br>- Good boy.<br>- Is that like Runie's seat belt?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Runie, play with Rey. Go!<br><br>Go play.<br><br>What do you think?<br>Do you think it'll work out?<br><br>I think they'll become friends soon.<br><br>Would you be willing to send Runie<br>to Uncle if he agreed to adopt him?<br><br>I think he'll be okay here.<br><br>Okay, good.<br><br>Give me a minute.<br><br>Jin-guk.<br><br>Best of luck.<br><br>Thanks. I got this!<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>- Uncle!<br>- Hi, Jin-guk.<br><br>Good to see you.<br><br>What? Did you get your eyebrows tattooed?<br><br>Oh, I asked them to make it last long,<br><br>and they made it look so dark.<br><br>They'll easily last for ten years.<br><br>You think so? That'd be great.<br><br>- Come this way.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Min-jeong's doing well, right?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>She's pregnant with her second child.<br><br>Congratulations.<br><br>Is it a boy or a girl?<br><br>A girl.<br><br>But I think I should go<br>to Boston soon to see her.<br><br>I'll find out more once I get there,<br><br>but Min-jeong has preeclampsia,<br>and it's quite serious.<br><br>Both Min-jeong and her baby<br>may end up in critical condition.<br><br>My wife flew there last week<br>to look after our first grandchild,<br><br>and my flight's next week.<br><br>But I have no idea how long<br>I'll end up staying there.<br><br>I'm thinking six months at the least.<br><br>I may end up staying there<br>a little over a year.<br><br>Then what about Rey?<br>Who will look after him?<br><br>For real?<br><br>That's why I wanted to see you today.<br><br>You're the only person<br>I can trust, you know.<br><br>I'll return as soon as Min-jeong<br>gives birth without any problems.<br><br>Help me out just this once.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Thanks, Jin-guk.<br><br>Don't mention it. You've<br>helped me out so much.<br><br>I should help you, of course.<br><br>Thankfully, my cousin knows<br>a lot about retrievers.<br><br>I'll ask him for help and<br>take good care of Rey.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Thanks a lot.<br><br>No problem.<br><br>By the way, your aunt and I had a talk.<br><br>The money we borrowed<br>you to open that café.<br><br>Do you still owe us 30,000 dollars?<br><br>You don't need to pay us back.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>We didn't say anything because<br>you insisted on paying us back.<br><br>Your aunt said you can just<br>use the money to look after Rey.<br><br>Still, I should pay you back...<br><br>No, you'd better do as I say.<br><br>It'll help us feel more at ease.<br><br>All right, then.<br><br>Gosh, I'm relieved now.<br><br>I bet you knew about it from the get-go.<br><br>Hey! I'd never lie to you.<br><br>You lie to me every day!<br><br>That's not true! Only once in a while.<br><br>You've done this to me many times.<br><br>What will you do now?<br><br>Hey, I'm all flustered too right now.<br><br>Why are you flustered?<br>This is all your fault!<br><br>Okay! Let's cool off for a moment.<br><br>We're going to the riverside park.<br><br>I promised Runie I'd play with him there.<br><br>Runie!<br><br>Come here, Runie!<br><br>Rey, this won't take long. Hold on, okay?<br><br>Doesn't this feel nice?<br><br>"JOO A-MIN"<br>"IN JEJU"<br><br>Why are you so handsome?<br><br>Did you get your good looks from me?<br><br>Let's see. Good boy!<br><br>"MY FAVORITE RED BEAN BUN"<br><br>It feels so nice, doesn't it?<br><br>"Damian"?<br><br>Good boy. We're all done.<br><br>Feels nice, right?<br><br>Damian?<br><br>"DAMIAN"<br>"BAKERY"<br><br>Hey! Rey, where are you going?<br><br>Hey! Runie, get back here!<br><br>God, what a mess!<br><br>We won't find a house in Seoul<br><br>with a garden like A-min's<br>where dogs can run around and play.<br><br>I get that, but we don't<br>know this person at all.<br><br>That's why I'm saying we should meet her.<br><br>You said yourself that<br>the dogs here look happy.<br><br>I think that's a good sign.<br><br>If she loves and cares<br>about her dogs this much,<br><br>she's probably a good<br>person, don't you think?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Let's meet her, okay?<br><br>We can't solve anything by just<br>sitting here and racking our brains.<br><br>If it works out, that's great.<br><br>If it doesn't, we'll find another solution.<br><br>I told you I'd take care<br>of this no matter what.<br><br>Let's go there and meet her.<br><br>When?<br><br>We can go tomorrow.<br><br>Tomorrow? Don't you have to work?<br><br>I can take the day off. What about you?<br><br>I can too, but don't you think<br>we're rushing this too much?<br><br>If I take Rey home now,<br><br>my landlord will kick me out.<br><br>I was just helping you out<br>up until this morning.<br><br>But now, this is an urgent<br>matter to me as well.<br><br>I'm really sorry.<br><br>No, it's okay.<br><br>I was also hoping someone in the family<br>would take care of Runie.<br><br>I think you made the right decision.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>But if we want to fly to Jeju,<br>the dogs will have to fly cargo.<br><br>I don't think Runie can do that<br>because he's afraid of loud noises.<br><br>Then how about a road trip?<br>And we can take the ferry.<br><br>- A road trip?<br>- After you get married,<br><br>we won't really be able<br>to take a trip like this together.<br><br>It'll be nice.<br><br>Let's eat sashimi<br>when we get to Jeju. My treat!<br><br>Then are we going to eat<br>wild-caught longtooth grouper?<br><br>Just eat whatever I buy you.<br><br>Good boy.<br><br>Min-su, what breed is that dog?<br><br>Oh, that's an Afghan hound.<br>That breed is rare in Korea.<br><br>My gosh!<br><br>Wow, what a cool dog.<br><br>Hey, what's your name?<br><br>Careful, you'll drop your phone.<br><br>Hey! What did I say?<br><br>Jin-guk, your screen is all cracked anyway.<br><br>Just get a new phone, okay?<br><br>- Min-su.<br>- Yeah?<br><br>It's rare for me to apologize<br>to anyone this sincerely.<br><br>I'm really sorry!<br><br>For what?<br><br>- Hold on. Hey!<br>- This is unbelievable.<br><br>Hey! It's already shattered!<br><br>- I saw it!<br>- Shut up!<br><br>Okay! I'll shut up!<br><br>Damn you!<br><br>If you see it, you'll just get more upset.<br><br>- Hey, calm down. It can't be undone.<br>- Damn it!<br><br>Why did you use my phone?<br><br>I can't see anything on mine.<br><br>- Hand it over.<br>- Why?<br><br>- I'm going to smash it.<br>- Mine's already smashed.<br><br>Just hand it over!<br><br>You're so dead!<br><br>- What's wrong? What is it?<br>- Runie.<br><br>What is it? What's the matter, Runie?<br><br>What did you see?<br><br>Gosh! Hey, look!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>- My gosh.<br>- What do we do?<br><br>What kind of a lunatic<br>abandoned these puppies here?<br><br>Hey, can you see<br>if there's an animal shelter nearby?<br><br>My gosh.<br><br>"PUREUN ANIMAL SHELTER"<br><br>Hello.<br><br>They've been weaned.<br><br>Looks like they were fed this morning.<br><br>Would you be able to keep them here?<br><br>I'm sorry, but we're filled to capacity<br>at the moment.<br><br>You'll have to find another shelter.<br><br>Where should I take them?<br><br>I'll be honest.<br><br>People rarely adopt mixed-breed dogs.<br><br>So even if you take<br>them to another shelter,<br><br>they'll most likely end up being put down.<br><br>You mean they'll be euthanized?<br><br>Last year, we had a cocker spaniel<br>that was pregnant.<br><br>So I posted on social media that we<br>were expecting cocker spaniel puppies,<br><br>and so many people were interested<br>in adopting them.<br><br>But when the puppies were born,<br><br>I realized they were mixed-breeds.<br><br>When people found out about it,<br>they all changed their minds.<br><br>I mean, I get it.<br><br>But all living beings are precious.<br>How could they...<br><br>Anyway, that cocker<br>spaniel had five puppies.<br><br>I held out for as long as I could<br>to get them adopted.<br><br>But the holding period came to an end,<br><br>so I had to put them down.<br><br>All five of them?<br><br>The mother too.<br><br>To be honest,<br><br>we have some puppies<br>that came in with their moms.<br><br>I have no idea what will happen to them.<br><br>Do you know if there are<br>any shelters in the area<br><br>where the situation is a little better?<br><br>It's probably all the same, more or less.<br><br>Why did you bring them back?<br><br>She said all of them would die<br>if we leave them here.<br><br>Don't they look after abandoned dogs here?<br><br>Yes, they do.<br><br>But mixed-breeds rarely get adopted,<br>so they all get put down in the end.<br><br>Even so, you can't just bring them back.<br><br>What are we going to do with them?<br><br>That person in Jeju<br>might agree to take them.<br><br>But we won't find out until we get there.<br><br>What if she says no?<br><br>Just take them back.<br><br>But how...<br><br>I can't do it. I feel as though<br>I'm the one killing them.<br><br>I guess this master<br>negotiator should step in.<br><br>It was on my way home.<br><br>I suddenly heard a dog cry,<br>so I ran over there.<br><br>A dog was hung on a tree,<br>getting beaten up by those men.<br><br>My goodness.<br><br>I kicked them all out<br>and got him down from the tree,<br><br>but his ribs were all broken already.<br><br>He could barely breathe.<br><br>But I guess he remembered me<br>feeding him a few times in the past.<br><br>When he saw me, he<br>started wagging his tail.<br><br>Had I come to his rescue sooner,<br>he wouldn't have died that day.<br><br>That experience traumatized me,<br><br>so I thought I should<br>do something, anything.<br><br>That's why I started taking in<br>abandoned dogs one by one.<br><br>And ten years have passed since then.<br><br>As the number of dogs grew,<br>people started sending donations.<br><br>At the moment, we have about 200 dogs.<br><br>But we still need a lot of things.<br><br>Most importantly, we<br>don't have enough space.<br><br>So we have no choice<br><br>but to put down the ones<br>that have been here the longest.<br><br>That dog too. They'll pick him up<br>at one to put him down.<br><br>When we found him abandoned,<br><br>we noticed that he had been declawed.<br><br>What? Why?<br><br>Some people who live in apartments...<br><br>declaw their dogs because<br>of the noise they hear<br><br>when their dogs scratch the floor.<br><br>What? But isn't that really painful?<br><br>Yes, it hurts a lot.<br><br>They at least shouldn't abandon them<br>after doing such a thing.<br><br>Gosh, I feel so bad for them.<br><br>Would you like to hold him?<br><br>Oh, sure.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>Good boy. You're so sweet.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Why is he suddenly making<br>that snoring sound?<br><br>Because he's excited.<br><br>He's so happy that someone's holding him.<br><br>Gosh. Don't cry, buddy.<br><br>Hey, you're so excited.<br><br>He seems very happy.<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Since you're all white,<br>I'll call you Baeksuk.<br><br>And you. Let's see.<br><br>My gosh, you kind of look like Jin-guk.<br><br>Then you can be Enemy.<br><br>Sorry, not Enemy. Guk... Guksu?<br><br>How about Guksu?<br><br>She gave me some food for the puppies.<br><br>Some leashes too.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>What? We should get going.<br><br>What's that under your shirt?<br><br>Didn't you say you were<br>a master negotiator?<br><br>Hey, look at this cutie.<br><br>Don't you want to know what his name is?<br><br>No, I don't.<br><br>His name is Thor, the son of Odin.<br><br>The God of Thunder. Loki's stepbrother.<br><br>He was supposed to be put down<br>at one, so I had no choice!<br><br>And having one more dog now<br>won't even make a difference.<br><br>You're in no position to yell at me now!<br><br>This little guy loves me.<br><br>He kept doing that, so what was I<br>supposed to do? Just let him die?<br><br>You brought four! I only brought one.<br><br>Is that important now?<br><br>Hey, we have to persuade<br>A-min no matter what.<br><br>Otherwise, these dogs are all screwed.<br><br>Okay. I'll get on my knees<br>if I have to, so don't worry.<br><br>You'd better.<br><br>I'll do it if I have to.<br><br>Get on your knees as soon as you meet her.<br><br>Can we get going?<br><br>"AIRBNB"<br><br>"AIRBNB"<br><br>Feels nice, right?<br><br>Hey, the coffee we had yesterday...<br><br>I use the same beans every day,<br><br>but it definitely tasted different<br>when you brewed it.<br><br>It was really cool.<br><br>The bean determines only 50 percent<br>of the taste of your coffee.<br><br>The other 50 percent is<br>determined by the barista.<br><br>I really hope you can open<br>another café down the road.<br><br>I bet that one will go bust too.<br><br>That's because<br>you refused to sell iced Americanos.<br><br>During the colder months,<br>you made up to 10,000 dollars monthly.<br><br>You see, I didn't want it to be<br>just like any other cafés.<br><br>I wanted to specialize in pour-over coffee.<br><br>The pour-over method<br><br>brings out all the flavors<br>and aromas of the beans.<br><br>Adding ice to that is like<br><br>locking down the aromas and flavors<br>that I worked hard to bring out.<br><br>Does that make sense to you?<br><br>But still, people want iced Americanos.<br><br>I don't want to compromise.<br><br>Pour-over coffee is my dream,<br>and I believe in it.<br><br>Hey, I worked so hard<br>in that sweat-filled basement gym<br><br>for over ten years,<br>selling my conscience and soul,<br><br>but I really don't want to sell my dream.<br><br>If I give up and even sell that,<br>I'll have no reason to exist.<br><br>I'll be nothing, really.<br><br>I brought it up because you look happy<br>when you're making coffee.<br><br>- Oh, gosh.<br>- My goodness.<br><br>- Here, have some.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Have fun.<br><br>Thank you for this!<br><br>- This looks so good.<br>- It does.<br><br>It's so sweet!<br><br>Hey, I couldn't afford to buy you<br>anything for your old café.<br><br>But if you open a new one,<br>I'll totally buy you something.<br><br>Hey, thanks. It's the thought that counts.<br><br>- Let's eat.<br>- I'm serious. Tell me what you need.<br><br>This is so good.<br><br>- It's really good.<br>- I know. Have more.<br><br>Hey, come out. Now!<br><br>Why won't you listen?<br><br>Come out and eat!<br><br>Are you not going to come out?<br><br>My gosh. Sir!<br><br>- Sir!<br>- Come out already!<br><br>- Why won't you listen?<br>- What's the matter?<br><br>This stupid dog won't eat.<br><br>Still, you can't do this.<br><br>Then what am I supposed to do?<br>It won't listen to me.<br><br>Sir, the dog can't eat because<br>it's kept on this heavy chain.<br><br>My gosh, it can barely move.<br><br>This way, it can't run away.<br><br>I'll go bring a lightweight leash.<br>I have one in the car.<br><br>I don't need one!<br>I'll just fatten it up and sell it.<br><br>You'll sell it? To whom?<br><br>What do you think? To a restaurant<br>that serves dog meat!<br><br>Come out!<br><br>Hey! You little...<br><br>I'll buy the dog. You<br>can sell it to me, okay?<br><br>Then pay me first.<br><br>How much?<br><br>I'd like at least 100 dollars.<br><br>I'll go get the money.<br><br>Thor! Good morning, Thor.<br><br>My sweet Thor.<br><br>It's okay. Come here.<br><br>Come here.<br><br>Come here, sweetie. It's okay. Come here.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Yes, come here.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>Thor.<br><br>Who's that?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I saw that old man<br>hitting this dog with a broom.<br><br>Why?<br><br>He wanted to fatten it up<br>and sell it to a restaurant,<br><br>but it wouldn't eat.<br><br>What are we going to do if A-min<br>doesn't want to take the dogs?<br><br>What do we do?<br><br>I asked you first.<br><br>I'm asking you because I don't know.<br><br>I wouldn't have asked you<br>had I known the answer.<br><br>Why would you ask me<br>if you didn't have the answer?<br><br>Because you're wiser than I am.<br><br>Oh, I see. Gosh...<br><br>Honestly,<br><br>I don't know what to do.<br><br>When you don't know what to do,<br>you must stay positive.<br><br>Hey, want to do the arm cross?<br>It's been a while.<br><br>Are you a kid?

I think it's a great idea.<br><br>Then will you add ice<br>to your pour-over coffee?<br><br>No. Not a chance.<br><br>What if the place goes bust again?<br><br>Hey, why didn't you buy an espresso machine<br>for your old café?<br><br>I didn't need it because<br>I specialize in pour-over coffee.<br><br>But the machine will allow you<br><br>to make iced Americanos<br>without ruining your pour-over coffee.<br><br>Well, that's true.<br><br>But good commercial espresso machines<br>are very expensive.<br><br>How much are they?<br><br>They're really expensive.<br><br>How much? A couple thousand dollars?<br><br>Hey! The good ones cost<br>well over 20,000 dollars.<br><br>All right.<br><br>I'll buy you one. I'll pay for it<br>in installments or something.<br><br>- But why?<br>- I told you.<br><br>I want to buy something for your new café.<br><br>And I'll help you out<br>on weekends, for free.<br><br>I wonder if Seong-gyeong<br>will be okay with that.<br><br>She will be, if I beg her on my knees.<br><br>Try it now.<br><br>You need to sit like this.<br>This angle is important.<br><br>It makes you look more sincere.<br><br>I've done it a lot, so I know.<br><br>- Like this?<br>- 45 degrees.

I'll build a big house for him<br>by the storage over there.<br><br>But he'll be cold in winter.<br><br>Golden retrievers have<br>a high cold tolerance.<br><br>They don't do well with hot weather.<br><br>But I'll build a nice house for him<br>so he can stay cool in summer.<br><br>I think...<br><br>I'll be okay with that.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>You couldn't find anyone<br>to look after Runie?<br><br>It's not that.

	<h1>Indian (2001) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Brave Indian policeman Raj beats up, then arrests Muslim terrorist Khan. This gets him promoted, and he is congratulated by none other than his father-in-law, who is also a very high ranking policeman. Suddenly, Raj finds out that many policemen would like to see Khan go free. He consults his father-in-law and surprisedly finds no support from him. Disagreements and arguments ensue, and his father-in-law gets killed as a result. The Police suspect Raj of killing him, they begin the process of arresting him, and he runs away--while Khan is all set to get freed to do whatever he likes.</p>

<br><br>Why do we keep going<br>back and forth?<br><br>Jay is happy here.<br><br>I don't care.<br><br>No, no.<br><br>We-<br><br>Let me call you back.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>Deidra wants full<br>custody of Jay.<br><br>Well?<br><br>She makes a few valid points.<br><br>Pam.<br><br>Looks like she's<br>completed parenting classes.<br><br>Steady job and her own place.<br><br>And it's true, you both<br>have a hectic schedule.<br><br>Plus you moved twice<br>in three years.<br><br>So?<br><br>A lot of people have<br>hectic schedules<br><br>and people move, so what?<br><br>It means that Jay had<br>to change schools twice.<br><br>And what I see, she's not<br>attacking you, Charles.<br><br>Her claim is Jay needs a mother.<br><br>I can have a petition<br>filed in with the court<br><br>by close of business today.<br><br>No, no courts.<br><br>All right, she sent me a<br>personal letter for a reason.<br><br>She's up to something.<br><br>The press finds out that there's<br>a custody battle brewing,<br><br>We need other options.<br><br>Charles, you do know<br>that I don't work for you?<br><br>You married my sister.<br><br>I'm only trying to help.<br><br>Pam, please.<br><br>He's sorry.<br><br>What are our options?<br><br>Reason with her.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Excuse me, miss, miss.<br><br>Excuse me, miss, excuse me?<br><br>Excuse me, miss.<br><br>- Deidra, Deidra.<br>- Excuse me?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>♪ You and I you and I<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Deidra, what are you doing?<br><br>"You and I" will<br>be released tomorrow<br><br>and every urban black radio<br>station in the country<br><br>will be picking it up.<br><br>Tammy, did you hear<br>what I just said?<br><br>She should have been here<br>30 minutes ago, Charles.<br><br>This is just her way<br>of defining the terms.<br><br>All right, it's what she does.<br><br>How could you be so<br>calm about all of this?<br><br>Well, because you're<br>nervous enough for both of us.<br><br>Look, now I'm open<br>to many things,<br><br>but giving up my son<br>is not an option.<br><br>I know we agreed to<br>leave our past in the past,<br><br>but what happened<br>between you and Deidra?<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Charles.<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>He has this little<br>basketball ritual<br><br>he's obsessed with these days.<br><br>I mean, I can go get him.<br><br>That's right,<br>the Steph Curry thing.<br><br>He told me about it.<br><br>No, it's fine.<br><br>I think we need to talk.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I was hoping that<br>we could speak alone,<br><br>'cause what needs to be said<br><br>shouldn't be said in front<br>of um, mixed company.<br><br>Whatever we need to talk about<br><br>can be said in front of Tammy.<br><br>Charles, it's okay.<br><br>You guys should talk.<br><br>So we're alone<br>just like you wanted.<br><br>Let's talk.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>You seem to have done<br>pretty well for yourself<br><br>since our divorce.<br><br>Can't help but wonder<br>if our little breakup<br><br>inspired some of these hits.<br><br>Deidra.<br><br>Kidding.<br><br>I am.<br><br>You're a great producer.<br><br>That's why I fell<br>in love with you.<br><br>But you married a star.<br><br>She's not me, but she's<br>a star nonetheless.<br><br>Look, I thought you<br>wanted to talk about Jay.<br><br>We are talking about Jay.<br><br>I've been doing better,<br><br>and so now I think it's time<br><br>for me to be the mother<br>Jay needs me to be.<br><br>And that's why I'm allowing<br>you to spend time with Jay.<br><br>Now after the hospital<br>discharged you,<br><br>I knew it was important<br>for Jay to see his mother,<br><br>but why full custody?<br><br>I mean, his life is stable.<br><br>I'm his mother and I<br>know what's best for him.<br><br>Then why haven't you been here?<br><br>It's been me and Tammy, not you.<br><br>Tammy isn't his real mother.<br><br>She's gotta go on tour.<br><br>She's gotta record.<br><br>He's my blood and not hers.<br><br>This is our family.<br><br>And Tammy is a part<br>of that now, Deidra.<br><br>But can you do it without me?<br><br>Look at this room.<br><br>Look, the awards, the prestige.<br><br>There's not an<br>ounce of me in it.<br><br>I am not gonna<br>apologize for my success.<br><br>You erased me.<br><br>But you're not gonna erase<br>me from Jay's life, too.<br><br>A boy needs his mother.<br><br>Let's start with<br>a few sleepovers.<br><br>Can we do that?<br><br>It's a start.<br><br>Mama.<br><br>- Hi baby.<br>- Hey.<br><br>You ready to go?<br><br>I have to get my bag.<br><br>Okay, um, where's your dad?<br><br>You know dad, some trip.<br><br>He'll be home tomorrow.<br><br>So you're alone with Tammy?<br><br>Yeah, Tammy and Aunt Pam<br>are out back doing yoga.<br><br>I can go get them.<br><br>Nope, don't.<br><br>Just go get your bag.<br><br>I have a lot of surprises<br><br>planned for you this<br>weekend, mister.<br><br>Okay, um, you wanna see my room?<br><br>I shouldn't.<br><br>It's cool, they won't mind.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I'm proud of you, sis.<br><br>The whole family is.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You know it doesn't<br>even feel really yet.<br><br>It will.<br><br>And when it does,<br><br>I'm here to negotiate<br>your new contract.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>I'm just happy you're here.<br><br>Sometimes I feel like the<br>third wheel around this place.<br><br>I thought Mr. Right<br>treated you like gold.<br><br>No, it is not that.<br><br>It's Deidra.<br><br>She haunts this place,<br><br>and if I even mention her,<br>Charles completely shuts down.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>I love it.<br><br>Um, you know what?<br><br>I think we should go to<br>someplace fancy for dinner.<br><br>Why don't you grab a jacket,<br><br>an extra outfit,<br>and something nice.<br><br>You think you can do that?<br><br>Mom, this is me<br>you're talking to.<br><br>Okay then.<br><br>Go and uh, get<br>something really nice.<br><br>No basketball jerseys.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Take your time.<br><br>What do you know about her?<br><br>Uh, not much.<br><br>Just that when Charles<br>filed for divorce,<br><br>she took it really hard<br><br>and disappeared when<br>Jay was younger.<br><br>She disappeared?<br><br>I guess.<br><br>But she is back now and<br>she appears to be stable<br><br>and she's ready to be a mom<br>again, so I'm happy for her.<br><br>Truly, I am, because<br>when she's good,<br><br>that means that Jay's good.<br><br>But aren't you curious<br>about what happened?<br><br>Nah.<br><br>I have to respect<br>that, you know?<br><br>Let the past be the past.<br><br>What about you?<br><br>What about me?<br><br>As long as<br>Jay's under this roof,<br><br>Deidre's gonna be coming around.<br><br>You need to know what<br>you're up against.<br><br>What does that<br>mean, "Up against?"<br><br>If I was her,<br><br>I'd wanna know everything<br>about the woman around my kid.<br><br>Especially if she's<br>about to become<br><br>the biggest star in the world.<br><br>Mama.<br><br>What are you doing<br>in dad's room?<br><br>I was looking for the restroom.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Come on, let's go.<br><br>You know,<br><br>I just want Deidra to respect<br>me and the way I care for Jay,<br><br>like I respect her.<br><br>Besides, I wanna have<br>kids of my own one day.<br><br>Well, if she keeps<br>disrespecting my sister,<br><br>I will show her how<br>real of a sister I am.<br><br>Ooh.<br><br>I'll stomp a hole<br>in her real quick.<br><br>What?<br><br>I'll knock her teeth out.<br>Don't get me started. Uhn-uh<br><br>T.<br><br>Uh, okay, so look,<br>I told Jay that I,<br><br>I could have stayed in the car.<br><br>If I overstepped.<br><br>Oh no, please, Deidre.<br><br>Don't be silly, we're-<br><br>- Thank you for allowing me<br><br>to take my child<br>for the weekend.<br><br>Um, you know what?<br><br>I wanna apologize<br>about the other day.<br><br>I'm truly grateful<br><br>for everything that<br>you've done for my child.<br><br>Is there any way that we<br>could just, I don't know.<br><br>Can we start over?<br><br>I'd like that.<br><br>Cool, how about tonight?<br><br>Tonight?<br><br>Um...<br><br>Yeah, my liquor cabinet,<br>it stays open pretty late.<br><br>Tonight may not<br>work, only because-<br><br>- Oh, I get it, that's right.<br><br>You probably have a bunch<br>of text messages to read.<br><br>It's okay, it's cool.<br><br>Come on baby, let's go.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>How late does your<br>liquor cabinet stay open?<br><br>It's not much,<br><br>but um, Jay has his own room<br><br>and it's in a good<br>school district.<br><br>Um, I think it's great.<br><br>Let's do this.<br><br>Let's.<br><br>So how did you meet Charles?<br><br>Uh, my sister, Pam.<br><br>Pam.<br><br>Cute.<br><br>Yeah, it's actually<br>a really funny story.<br><br>So they were- A toast.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What are we toasting to?<br><br>You, silly.<br><br>Your song, it's amazing.<br><br>It's the prettiest song<br>that I've ever heard.<br><br>Thank you, Deidra.<br><br>I almost feel like I<br>have a connection to it.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>No, it's funny you say that<br><br>because I felt the same<br>exact way when I heard it.<br><br>You heard it?<br><br>Yeah, the demo.<br><br>Charles had written<br>it years ago,<br><br>and when I heard this song,<br><br>I just knew I had to sing it.<br><br>So he never released it?<br><br>Uh-uh, he said he could never<br>find the right voice for it,<br><br>till now.<br><br>What exactly did<br>Charles tell you about me?<br><br>What does anybody ever<br>tell anyone about their ex?<br><br>- Fair enough.<br>- Mm.<br><br>Well, we met when I was<br>in my second year in college<br><br>and he had just had<br>this serious breakup<br><br>with Jessica Dawson.<br><br>Jessica Dawson.<br><br>By that look, you've<br>heard that name before.<br><br>She really broke his heart.<br><br>But her loss was my gain, right?<br><br>And I was in school<br>for computer graphics,<br><br>but he saw right through.<br><br>He knew I wanted to make music.<br><br>So you sing.<br><br>Dabbled.<br><br>You know Charles, he makes<br>you feel like a star.<br><br>Mm.<br><br>He used to keep his uh,<br>his songs in these journals.<br><br>Yeah, he still does that.<br><br>And we would go to the studio<br><br>and we would record<br>these amazing love songs.<br><br>But then it led to more love<br>making than making music.<br><br>I think sex inspires him.<br><br>And then Jay was born and uh,<br><br>there was no more<br>time for music.<br><br>At least that's what he told me.<br><br>So is that why you stopped?<br><br>We both did.<br><br>We got married and we tried<br>to make the family thing work.<br><br>He went back to work at a<br>old manufacturing plant.<br><br>I went back to school<br>and we really tried,<br><br>and we were a family,<br>until we weren't.<br><br>He didn't tell you that, did he?<br><br>Uh, no.<br><br>Just that I'm a crazy<br>mama that abandoned her kid.<br><br>No, Deidre, he never said any-<br><br>- I had so much love<br>for him, for our family,<br><br>until he got arrested.<br><br>That was the<br>beginning of the end.<br><br>Arrested?<br><br>I've said too much.<br><br>No, you haven't said enough.<br><br>What was he arrested for?<br><br>Whatever happened<br>with us is in the past.<br><br>He's with you now.<br><br>Yeah, but he never<br>told me any of this.<br><br>I'm not gonna start any more<br>trouble than I already have.<br><br>He's found his way<br>back to his music.<br><br>He's happy.<br><br>You're happy.<br><br>And Jay's happy.<br><br>I had a lawyer draw those<br>up and I signed them.<br><br>I realized that there was<br>no upside for a waitress<br><br>up against a successful<br>music producer in court.<br><br>Take it.<br><br>Besides, a custody<br>battle is no way to start<br><br>a healthy co-parenting<br>relationship.<br><br>Wow, Deidra.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>This was fun.<br><br>It was.<br><br>We should do it again.<br><br>Oh, by tomorrow,<br>you will be so famous<br><br>you won't remember that<br>cheap wine I served you.<br><br>Oh, from me, your<br>lips to God's ears.<br><br>And that wine was not<br>that cheap, Deidra.<br><br>That's just Renegade,<br>the neighbors dog.<br><br>It's, he's harmless.<br><br>He don't sound that harmless.<br><br>You get used to it.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>And what has got<br>you smiling so hard?<br><br>It's not a what, it's a who.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Who?<br><br>Some guy.<br><br>He uh, wants me to<br>send him a naughty pic.<br><br>Ooh, do you like him?<br><br>Yeah, maybe, I don't know.<br><br>Hey, do it, okay?<br><br>You only live once.<br><br>What, is he cute?<br><br>You'll see him soon enough.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well um, I should get going,<br><br>but I'm really glad we<br>got the chance to do this.<br><br>Likewise.<br><br>Thank you, Deidra.<br><br>You, uh, tell Charles<br>to stay outta trouble.<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>Tammy, why aren't you ready?<br><br>We have a meeting with<br>Satellite Radio at 11 o'clock.<br><br>All right, this industry<br>doesn't give second chances.<br><br>We can't blow this.<br><br>You know, that's funny,<br>because you got a second chance.<br><br>What?<br><br>I went and saw<br>Deidre last night.<br><br>Why would you do that?<br><br>You know, probably<br>for the same reason<br><br>you never told me why<br>you were arrested.<br><br>Look, baby.<br><br>Look, do not "baby" me.<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>Look, it's the past, all right?<br><br>She's the past.<br><br>All right, let it go.<br><br>Why didn't you tell<br>me that she sings,<br><br>or anything about<br>her for that matter?<br><br>Or should I let that go, too?<br><br>What else are you<br>hiding from me, Charles?<br><br>It's not what you think.<br><br>Look, I did it for Jay.<br><br>Okay, I kept secrets for him.<br><br>All right, look.<br><br>I was arrested for assault.<br><br>All right, some<br>guy said I hit him<br><br>after I saw him and<br>Deidra flirting.<br><br>I got jealous and<br>confronted him.<br><br>And did you hit him?<br><br>No, no, but the police<br>didn't believe me.<br><br>I was a hothead back then<br><br>and it wasn't the first time<br>I was in trouble with the law.<br><br>Not your first time?<br><br>Look, our<br>relationship was toxic.<br><br>She reveled in the drama.<br><br>Yeah, but why<br>didn't you tell me?<br><br>Well, I had my record expunged.<br><br>Right, I paid a PR<br>team to erase me<br><br>and Deidra's internet history<br><br>because I didn't<br>want Jay to know<br><br>he had a father<br>that was a criminal<br><br>and a mother who went to a<br>mental health institution.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>I bet she left<br>that part out, too.<br><br>Well, did she sing?<br><br>Did she sing?<br><br>Yeah, a little.<br><br>But she wasn't a star.<br><br>Not like you.<br><br>Charles, I am your wife.<br><br>Do you know how stupid I felt?<br><br>It's like I don't even know you.<br><br>Now you know me.<br><br>So does Deidra and Jessica.<br><br>Look, I know I betrayed<br>your trust in the past,<br><br>and I know I don't deserve<br>it, but I'm asking you,<br><br>look Tammy, you're<br>raising my son.<br><br>Hell, I won't pretend that<br>I can do this without you.<br><br>No more secrets, Tammy.<br><br>Okay, I promise.<br><br>Deidra's not seeking<br>full custody anymore.<br><br>She's okay with co-parenting.<br><br>Well, well how?<br><br>I mean.<br><br>Does it matter?<br><br>It's done.<br><br>Hey, I mean, I don't<br>know what to say.<br><br>I mean, I'm just-<br><br>- You know what, Charles, just,<br><br>promise me you'll be honest<br>with me from here on out.<br><br>Baby, I promise.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Charles' file is sealed,<br><br>but the other guy's file isn't.<br><br>Jimmy Franklin, a real shit bag.<br><br>Habitual criminal with<br>more assault charges<br><br>than he has birthdays.<br><br>How will this help<br>me get to the truth?<br><br>Charles didn't do it.<br><br>He didn't?<br><br>Page six, superstar.<br><br>What is this I'm looking at?<br><br>It's a transcript<br>from a criminal case<br><br>where Jimmy was a<br>state star witness.<br><br>The defense attorney<br>raised concerns<br><br>about his credibility<br>as a witness.<br><br>He cites Charles's<br>case as his reason.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Jimmy Franklin knowingly and<br>willingly pressed false charges<br><br>on Charles Harper<br>only to drop his claim<br><br>after his allegations<br>could not be corroborated.<br><br>Why would he do that?<br><br>Why does any man do<br>what he does for a woman?<br><br>I gotta go.<br><br>I have this IG Live thing I<br>have to do, but thank you.<br><br>You're amazing.<br><br>Wait, be careful.<br><br>That woman isn't playing<br>with a full deck.<br><br>According to our records,<br><br>you and Ms. Deidre Love<br>conspired against Mr.

talk.<br><br>In my office, now.<br><br>That doesn't matter.<br><br>Look, we should be already<br>on the next single.<br><br>Hell, the next three singles.<br><br>Tammy is a star.<br><br>The industry hasn't<br>seen an artist like her<br><br>in over 10 years.<br><br>Yeah, but we need something new,<br><br>something fresh, something<br>vibrant, and have her-<br><br>- We need to talk.<br><br>This is

all of that.<br><br>But I have a hard time with<br>one part of your story.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>He knew your address.<br><br>Photos were taken of you.<br><br>Text messages.<br><br>Yeah, they were all fake.<br><br>I'm trying to tell<br>y'all, it's Deidra.<br><br>I have never used an app<br>like that before in my life.<br><br>But this man had a key.<br><br>Was that also fake?<br><br>The alarm wasn't on.<br><br>Is there a reason for that?<br><br>Because it's a safe<br>damn neighborhood.<br><br>This, whatever this is, is over.<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>Excuse me, I'm Pam<br>Newman, I'm her attorney.<br><br>I'm taking a statement.<br><br>Sounds to me like<br>you already have it.<br><br>I'm collecting facts.<br><br>Well, let me tell you<br>one fact you do know.<br><br>A man broke into the home.<br><br>No, he entered<br>the home with a key.<br><br>And attacked my client<br>and she defended herself,<br><br>which is her right.<br><br>So if you're not sure what you<br>need from my client, leave.<br><br>And call me when<br>you make a decision.<br><br>We'll be in touch.<br><br>You don't speak with<br>no one without me again.<br><br>Do you hear me?<br><br>I'm not going to let<br>anything happen to you.<br><br>It's gonna be okay.<br><br>Tammy?<br><br>Oh baby, are you okay?<br><br>I tried calling you.<br><br>Oh, I know.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>How are you?<br><br>Detectives<br>think I invited him in.<br><br>Look, baby, I don't want you<br>to worry about any of that.<br><br>We're going to take care of<br>it, I promise, all right?<br><br>You need to get her out of here.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>The media catches wind of<br>this it's gonna be a circus.<br><br>Can we take your car?<br><br>Yes, but we're going to<br>need to make a statement.<br><br>I'm, I'm on it.<br><br>We need something now<br><br>before someone else<br>creates the narrative.<br><br>I'll figure it out.<br><br>No, I'll handle it.<br><br>You just get her as far<br>away from here as possible.<br><br>I know a team that can<br>clean up the crime scene<br><br>while we're away.<br><br>Just stop, stop.<br><br>I'm not leaving.<br><br>We can't stay here.<br><br>So what, I'm supposed<br>to go out there?<br><br>You think that's gonna<br>bring me peace of mind?<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>This is not a crime scene.<br><br>This is our home and I<br>will not be run away.<br><br>Someone was in here.<br><br>Now we need to think<br>smart about this<br><br>until I can hire<br>a security team.<br><br>I mean, what if there's<br>another deranged fan out there?<br><br>This wasn't a fan.<br><br>It was Deidre.<br><br>Deidra?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Look, the pictures<br>were all fake.<br><br>Yes, it was my face,<br>but it was not my body.<br><br>That doesn't mean it was her.<br><br>Crazy fans make fake<br>photos all the time.<br><br>What about the call?<br><br>You didn't hear her voice.<br><br>Yeah, but my bangle<br>and, and, and lingerie.<br><br>It was missing.<br>Tammy.<br><br>So y'all think I'm crazy.<br><br>No, but we can't rock<br>the boat with Deidre<br><br>or anyone right now.<br><br>And making accusations we<br>can't prove can backfire on us.<br><br>You're a person of<br>interest in a crime.<br><br>A crime that could<br>sent you to jail<br><br>for the rest of your<br>natural black life.<br><br>If Deidre is behind this,<br><br>tipping her off right now<br>that you suspect something<br><br>isn't going to help.<br><br>So what, huh?<br><br>What, you, you, you saying<br>I should do nothing?<br><br>I'm saying let me do my job.<br><br>Let, let us fix this, all right?<br><br>Let me worry about Jay and<br>we'll get through this together.<br><br>All right?<br>Mmhm.<br><br>It's gonna be okay.<br><br>She's doing okay.<br><br>Tonight was a difficult night.<br><br>Tammy is resting comfortably<br><br>surrounded by the<br>people who love her.<br><br>Tammy's not only a celebrity,<br><br>but she's a loving<br>wife and mother.<br><br>- You lying bitch.<br>- We ask for privacy<br><br>during this difficult time.<br><br>- Ain't nobody's mother.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>It's a lie.<br><br>Everyone on the internet<br><br>is saying that Tammy<br>killed someone.<br><br>Oh no, it's true, baby.<br><br>I think I need to be with them.<br><br>No, no, you're safe.<br><br>You're safe here with me.<br><br>But Tammy needs me.<br><br>She's always been there for me.<br><br>She needs you?<br><br>She need a God damn lawyer.<br><br>She not thinking<br>about you right now.<br><br>I'm going home.<br><br>You are home.<br><br>No, I'm calling dad.<br><br>He's busy.<br><br>His wife just murdered somebody<br><br>and she's facing jail time<br>for the rest of her life.<br><br>She's not thinking about you.<br><br>You should appreciate the fact<br><br>that I'm trying to<br>keep you here safe.<br><br>You acting just like<br>your damn daddy.<br><br>It's better than<br>acting like you.<br><br>Jay?<br><br>Shit.<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>I'm Detective Fletcher.<br><br>Oh, now is not a<br>good time, Officer.<br><br>What, what's this about?<br><br>Just need to ask<br>a few questions.<br><br>About?<br><br>Are we able to go inside?<br><br>I'm on my way to work.<br><br>That's odd.<br><br>You no longer work there.<br><br>I checked.<br><br>How may I help you?<br><br>It's about your ex-husband.<br><br>Is this about last night?<br><br>I was here with my son,<br><br>and I'm afraid I<br>don't know anything.<br><br>How about I come<br>back at a later time?<br><br>That would be best.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>Go to your room.<br><br>What is that?<br><br>Go to your room.<br><br>Baby, I'm sorry.<br><br>I would never do<br>anything to hurt you.<br><br>What you saw is not<br>what you think you saw.<br><br>And you're right about Tammy.<br><br>She didn't kill anyone.<br><br>What you saw in the room was<br>me trying to help the police.<br><br>They asked me to help.<br><br>I know this is scary,<br><br>but I was just doing<br>my part trying to help.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>They said somebody might<br>be trying to hurt me, too.<br><br>I will never let<br>anything happen to you.<br><br>I'll protect you.<br><br>That's my baby.<br><br>Now what do we do?<br><br>We stick together.<br><br>You and me.<br><br>They've been out<br>there all night.<br><br>I'm working on that.<br><br>I'll get the media to back off.<br><br>It's just, I know<br>Deidre's behind this.<br><br>Anybody with eyes can see that,<br><br>but me having a law agree is<br>advising you to see what I see.<br><br>And what is that?<br><br>The police will subpoena<br>Deidre's internet provider<br><br>for her IP address's activity.<br><br>It'll be all over soon.<br><br>She's done.<br><br>It doesn't feel that way.<br><br>I need a favor,<br>from Detective Pam.<br><br>What do you mean Jay<br>doesn't want to come home?<br><br>No, let me talk to him.<br><br>I tried calling him all night.<br><br>He's not answering his phone.<br><br>Just put him on<br>the phone, Deidre.<br><br>What?<br><br>I don't need to calm down.<br><br>What?<br><br>You can't do that.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Deidre.<br><br>Damn it!<br><br>How long you been<br>standing there?<br><br>Long enough.<br><br>Go, you need to see him.<br><br>I'm, I'm not leaving you.<br><br>I am not a porcelain doll.<br><br>Jay needs you, go check on him.<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>We're leaving.<br><br>Wait, he, wait.<br><br>He wants to stay.<br><br>I don't have time for this.<br><br>Jay, Jay.<br>Calm down, calm down.<br><br>Look, I'm not letting you<br>in here until you calm down.<br><br>We are going to speak as adults.<br><br>That boy is scared<br>enough as it is already.<br><br>How did you get these so fast?<br><br>I don't disclose my techniques.<br><br>Wow they look so real.<br><br>It's a deep fake.<br><br>She's crazier than I thought.<br><br>Yeah, but why?<br><br>Charles was open to having<br>her be in Jay's life.<br><br>I just...<br><br>Something must<br>have triggered her.<br><br>It's the prettiest song<br>that I've ever heard.<br><br>I feel like I have a,<br>a connection to it.<br><br>You know what?<br><br>Let me call you back.<br><br>Are you really gonna<br>keep me from my son?<br><br>What the hell are<br>you doing, Deidra?<br><br>What am I doing?<br><br>Uh, someone was<br>killed in your house,<br><br>and you really want<br>him to go back to that?<br><br>Then we'll leave.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>He'll love that.<br><br>Another move in the<br>middle of the school year.<br><br>And let me guess, being with<br>you was the only solution?<br><br>Last time I checked, no<br>one died in my living room.<br><br>Jay is a child.<br><br>He needs time to process.<br><br>He's safer here.<br><br>He's safe with me.<br><br>That's not good enough for me.<br><br>Not good enough, for you?<br><br>I'm doing what's<br>best for my son.<br><br>By brainwashing him against me?<br><br>Last time I saw your wife,<br><br>she was leaving with a suitcase,<br><br>and the next day<br>she's killing someone.<br><br>Your house is unstable,<br><br>and it's been like<br>that for a minute.<br><br>I'd be happy to talk to the<br>press about my concerns.<br><br>Oh, so this<br>is what it comes down to?<br><br>Okay, let's cut the bullshit.<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>I want our son safe.<br><br>I'm looking out for him.<br><br>Someone has to and clearly<br>Tammy can't do that.<br><br>This isn't about Tammy.<br><br>This is about you and me.<br><br>You made it about Tammy<br>when you gave her our song.<br><br>Song?<br><br>What, what, what are<br>you talking about?<br><br>You're crazy.<br><br>And your wife is a killer.<br><br>You sure know how to<br>pick 'em, Charles.<br><br>♪ Love me right, love<br>me right, do me right ♪<br><br>♪ Why do you, hold me tight,<br>never lie, you're right ♪<br><br>♪ You and I<br><br>♪ You and I, you and I<br><br>♪ You and I, you and I<br><br>I'm not leaving without my son.<br><br>Can I at least<br>collect his things<br><br>and explain to him<br>why he has to go?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Wait here.<br><br>Hey, is everything okay?<br><br>Charles, Deidre sang<br>the demo for "You and I?"<br><br>No, I mean, yeah, yeah.<br><br>Look, it's complicated.<br><br>Uncomplicate it for me.<br><br>Tammy, it's not what you think.<br><br>Enough with the cryptic talk.<br><br>Look, all right,<br><br>we played around with the<br>song in the studio once,<br><br>like 13 years ago.<br><br>It wasn't for a demo, right?<br><br>It was for us.<br><br>We were just being<br>silly, it was nothing.<br><br>Yeah, but it was<br>everything to Deidre.<br><br>You know, in her mind, she<br>thinks that I'm singing her song.<br><br>The song that you<br>wrote for her family.<br><br>The family that<br>I'm a part of now.<br><br>Look, I didn't expect-<br><br>- I told you to promise me<br><br>that you would always be<br>honest with me about your past.<br><br>And here I am finding out<br>another secret you hid from me.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Your sorry's are starting to<br>become meaningless, Charles.<br><br>Let me know when you<br>and Jay are on the way.<br><br>Tammy.<br><br>Damn.<br><br>Jay, let's go.<br><br>Is dad mad?<br><br>No, but we're leaving, let's go.<br><br>Where to?<br><br>I don't have time to<br>answer any of your questions.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Just leave it.<br><br>But what about dad?<br><br>Boy, you'll be with<br>your dad soon, I promise.<br><br>The police tracked<br>the IP address back to Deidra.<br><br>An arrest warrant<br>has been issued.<br><br>They're on their way now.<br><br>So it's over.<br><br>When she's arrested,<br><br>I'll issue a press release and<br>you can rebuild your family,<br><br>and all of this will be over.<br><br>I'm gonna call Charles,<br>but I love you, sis.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>I love you, too.<br><br>Tammy?<br><br>Charles?<br><br>Baby, you don't sound too good.<br><br>Charles, speak to me.<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I think, I think Deidra hit me.<br><br>What?<br><br>She's lost her mind.<br><br>Okay, are, are you okay?<br><br>Where's Jay?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Jay?<br><br>Jay?!<br><br>Charles, what is going on?<br><br>She has Jay.<br><br>Call the police, now.<br><br>How is your burger?<br><br>Why are we here?<br><br>There's a lot of people that<br>don't wanna see us together.<br><br>And Miss Pam is a lawyer<br>and she's gonna help us.<br><br>Then why don't we just<br>go to Aunt Pam's house?<br><br>I know where it is from here.<br><br>It's too dangerous.<br><br>She's gonna meet us here.<br><br>It's been over an hour.<br><br>How much longer do we<br>have to sit out here for?<br><br>You know I love you, right?<br><br>And I would never let<br>anything or anyone hurt you.<br><br>I refuse to let that happen.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Mommy's gonna go<br>away for a while.<br><br>I'm coming with you.<br><br>No, not this time.<br><br>But you said it yourself.<br><br>I need to protect you.<br><br>And you have done<br>a wonderful job.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>It's not important.<br><br>But what is important<br><br>is that we got a chance to<br>spend some time together.<br><br>Okay, mom.<br><br>She's waking up.<br><br>Could you go get a nurse?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Where am I?<br><br>There's been an accident.<br><br>- I got it.<br>- Relax.<br><br>I don't remember anything.<br><br>Deidre's behind this.<br><br>I know she is.<br><br>She's desperate.<br><br>She took Jay and ran, she's,<br><br>you know, I'm afraid to think<br>of what she's even capable of.<br><br>You don't remember anything?<br><br>I can't remember.<br><br>I wish I could remember<br>anything to bury the bitch.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>How do you feel?<br><br>I'm okay.<br><br>Okay, careful.<br><br>So there's<br>nothing more you can do?<br><br>Sir, we're doing all we can.<br><br>All you can?<br><br>My wife told you<br><br>that Deidra was behind<br>us from the beginning.<br><br>If you had arrested her, none<br>of this would be happening.<br><br>That's not the way<br>it works, Mr. Harper.<br><br>I understand your frustration.<br><br>Do you?<br><br>Because I don't think you do.<br><br>My son is missing.<br><br>Someone is in the hospital.<br><br>I was almost killed and<br>my wife was attacked.<br><br>You don't understand shit.<br><br>Should I answer it?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Put it on speaker.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Do we have an audience?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Take me off speaker, just you.<br><br>Look, I need to hear everything.<br><br>I will tell you everything.<br><br>Just please let me handle this.<br><br>This could be our only chance.<br><br>Just keep her on the phone<br>for as long as you can.<br><br>Are you there?<br><br>Um, yeah, I'm, I'm here.<br><br>Jay wants to talk to you<br><br>and I want this to be over.<br><br>Is he safe?<br><br>Let's just end this.<br><br>Woman to woman, just you and me.<br><br>If you do anything stupid,<br><br>you won't ever get<br>to see Jay again.<br><br>Get rid of them<br>and call me back.<br><br>How am I supposed to do that?<br><br>You're a smart<br>girl, figure it out.<br><br>Okay, well, where are you?<br><br>Listen clearly, I don't care<br>what you say to

Don't die yet!<br><br>Ma'am, I assure you, my intentions<br>for Josie are pure and decent.<br><br>Even if it's indecent, it's okay with me.<br><br>Ma'am, do you plan to stay long here?<br><br>Just a week.<br><br>Oh, it's not obvious with your baggage.<br><br>Sorry sweetheart, Pia here is not<br>very familiar with the word vacation.<br><br>- Benjo?<br>- Yes?<br><br>Are you sure it's okay with your<br>boss that we stay at your place?<br><br>I' m sure. Sir Alex is a good guy<br>and he knows you're coming.<br><br>Okay. That' s good.<br><br>Benjo, how long<br>have you been working here?<br><br>8 years. I used to be a waiter and a cook.<br><br>I just got promoted when Sir Alex<br>started to manage the taverna.<br><br>8 years? When did you get promoted?<br><br>6 months ago,<br>when the owner of the taverna...<br><br>Sir Stav left for Colombia.<br><br>He found out that<br>his first love Elena got widowed.<br><br>He planned to close down<br>the taverna to be with her.<br><br>Then?<br><br>When Sir Alex found that the taverna<br>will be closed down, he felt sorry for us.<br><br>So he volunteered to manage the taverna.<br><br>Oh, how romantic<br>Stav and Elena's story is.<br><br>Imagine, Stav waited<br>for Elena's husband to die...<br><br>then he left everything for her.<br><br>- That is sweet.<br>- Nanny, that's not sweet.<br><br>He didn't care about Benjo<br>and his other workers.<br><br>Good thing there is someone<br>who really cares for them.<br><br>You know what Pia, when you fall in love,<br>you will eat your words.<br><br>Ah, no nanny.<br>I will not let that happen to me.<br><br>- You can never can tell.<br>- You can never can tell.<br><br>- Pendong kulas!<br>- Pendong kulas!<br><br>Beautiful!<br><br>- Sweetheart, are you okay?<br>- Yes, I'm fine.<br><br>I forgot to tell you how<br>narrow the staircases...<br><br>- in Greece are.<br>- Sorry for the luggage.<br><br>You can stay at the room<br>of Sir Stav, Ma'am Pia.<br><br>Nanny, what are these?<br><br>Oh, what am I going to use this for?<br><br>Wait a second. Correct me if l' m wrong.<br><br>Did you not tell me that<br>we should always be beautiful?<br><br>What if you find some guy<br>here in Santorini...<br><br>then you fall in love with him?<br><br>Do you want him to see you<br>looking like an old maid?<br><br>You know it's not my plan here in Greece<br>to look for a long distance relationship.<br><br>You know what I need to do?<br><br>I need to think! I need to study<br>and I need to rest!<br><br>Chit, bro.<br><br>Like what I've told you last week,<br>I cannot join you.<br><br>I mean, if Regatta is far from<br>the Philippines, I won't hesitate to join.<br><br>But if my mom finds out that<br>l' m just near the Philippines...<br><br>she won't let me come back here.<br><br>You know what,<br>you should try living here in Greece.<br><br>Life here is simple,<br>with delicious food and pretty ladies.<br><br>I' m tired. I' ll just stay here.<br><br>- How about you? Are you not tired yet?<br>- I don't want to waste my time sleeping!<br><br>Nanny, are you not forgetting something?<br><br>Yes. Good thing you told me.<br><br>It's hot outside.<br>Okay, l' ll leave now. Bye.<br><br>Nanny, you're still forgetting something.<br><br>What else? Oh yeah, I stink.<br><br>- Let me use your cologne, will you?<br>- Uhmmm.<br><br>This is how I should put on cologne, right?<br><br>- Thanks. I' ll go ahead.<br>- Really, I taught you that? You' re good.<br><br>Okay, l' ll see you later.<br><br>Nanny!<br><br>What?!<br><br>Aren't you even going to wear pants?<br><br>Is that it? No need. I' m wearing undies.<br><br>Hideous.<br><br>I' m ready.<br><br>I was born ready.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Benjo.<br><br>Benjo!<br><br>What the...<br><br>- Rapist! Maniac!<br>- Hey, wait wait!<br><br>- You' re sick! What are you doing here?!<br>- Hey, if you think I will rape you...<br><br>I' m not that drunk and l' ll have you pay<br>for what you're doing!<br><br>Aren't you going to answer that?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>- Nanny, where are you?<br>- Sophia, make sure this is important.<br><br>- Nanny, a maniac broke in my room.<br>- Because if it's not...<br><br>- What?<br>- Come here! Hurry!<br><br>We need to go home. Hurry!<br><br>- You-<br>- Pia, who did you kill?<br><br>- Benjo, help me here.<br>- What happened?<br><br>Who is that? Who is he?<br><br>Ma'am Pia, don't you know who he is?<br><br>That is the worthless ex- boyfriend<br>of every girl, of every one!<br><br>- Of all the unfortunate things to happen.<br>- He is Sir Alex. My boss, the manager.<br><br>That is your manager?<br><br>Impossible! He is a cheater!<br><br>Do you know how many girls cried<br>because of that guy?<br><br>- Many.<br>- Yes, many.<br><br>And his name is not Alex.<br><br>Seth Villaraza.<br><br>- Really?<br>- Really?<br><br>- Pendong Kulas!<br>- Pendong Kulas!<br><br>Sir, are you okay? Sir?<br><br>I don't know which is more hurtful,<br>the book you threw at me, or your insults.<br><br>Well, l' m only telling the truth!<br><br>Yes, that's true.<br>But you have never been my girlfriend...<br><br>so you have no right to kill me!<br><br>Really? You haven't been his girlfriend?<br><br>Put those down. Put those down.<br>You look stupid.<br><br>Is she really that rude?<br><br>Oh no, Pia is a good girl.<br>She's nice and sweet...<br><br>sir Alex, Seth.<br><br>Wait, what shall I call you?<br>What is your real name?<br><br>Seth Alexander.<br><br>But people here prefer to call me Alex.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>- Nanny Josie, let's go.<br>- Why? I' m not telling you to go.<br><br>Seeing the turn of events...<br><br>I think it would be best<br>if nanny Josie and l...<br><br>will just go and look for<br>another hotel to stay in.<br><br>Where will you go?<br><br>- Just stay here.<br>- Nanny.<br><br>Let's just forget about what happened.<br><br>It's peak season,<br>you won't find a place to stay.<br><br>No, thank you.<br><br>Pia, it is an insult here in Greece to<br>decline a kind of hospitality like this.<br><br>Look Mr. Villaraza.<br><br>It's enough torture that<br>we are in a same country.<br><br>I don't want to torture myself more<br>and stay under one roof with you.<br><br>Nanny! Let's go!<br><br>- Suit yourself.<br>- Nanny!

Okay?<br><br>What's this?<br><br>You have a lot of nerves, huh?<br><br>Why did you just do that?<br><br>Because I've already mastered<br>your playboy style!<br><br>Style? What style?<br><br>That! You' ll approach the girl you like...<br><br>you' ll stand on her left,<br>then you' ll talk to her for a bit...<br><br>flirt with her a bit and then what?<br>What's next?<br><br>You' ll hold her hand...<br><br>and in just a short while<br>you already have her fooled...<br><br>she's already your girlfriend<br>without courting her.<br><br>- Wow! How did you know that?<br>- There.<br><br>I don't remember dating you.<br><br>Date me? Huh, you wish!<br><br>Okay, so how did you become<br>an expert on my style?<br><br>How do I know?<br><br>- You want?<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Because you've been<br>everybody's boyfriend...<br><br>- Seth.<br>- Everybody but you!<br><br>- So that's why you're so mad, huh?<br>- Excuse me!<br><br>Tell me, what do you really get out of<br>breaking the hearts of all those girls, huh?<br><br>What are you saying?<br>I hate break ups.<br><br>It's not a good feeling when you<br>know you've broken a girl's feelings.<br><br>Then don't hurt them!<br>Seth, it's that simple.<br><br>You know you don't even stay long enough<br>in a relationship to make it work.<br><br>- Aha!

They can have a life.<br><br>It's pointless that you volunteered<br>to manage the taverna...<br><br>if you don't really have plans<br>of making it profitable.<br><br>It's your responsibility to your<br>employees and their families...<br><br>to make the restaurant generate income.<br><br>You know what...<br><br>that's just like the article I read<br>about you last night on the internet.<br><br>Yeah!

His name is Diego.<br><br>But my father disapproved of him.<br><br>He said he's a cheater<br>and will only hurt me.<br><br>He is a womanizer with<br>many other girlfriends I am not aware of.<br><br>He is a bad influence to me.<br><br>With no direction in life.<br><br>He is a rocker that's why.<br><br>God, I thought love would conquer all!<br><br>You know what I did?<br><br>When Dad told me to go to Europe<br>and sent me away to stay there...<br><br>He sent me away.<br><br>- Diego and I eloped.<br>- What?!<br><br>- You eloped?<br>- Diego and I eloped.<br><br>Whoa!<br><br>There.<br><br>I really thought we will be okay but...<br><br>we had a car accident.<br><br>I stayed one week in the hospital.<br><br>Dad was very mad.<br><br>He prevented me from seeing and speaking<br>to Diego who was also in the hospital.<br><br>But of course I fought for it.<br><br>I still went out of my way to see him.<br><br>I went to the hospital.<br><br>I did not know that Diego and<br>his ex- girlfriend got back together.<br><br>He broke up with me because he found<br>our relationship too complicated.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>He simply gave up.<br>It was so easy for him.<br><br>Just that simple and easy for him.<br><br>He said he is suffering a lot.<br><br>I deeply hurt Dad.<br><br>And everytime I see him,<br>I feel like a very bad child.<br><br>As if I have so many mistakes<br>that I have to pay for.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Why?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>All along I thought<br>I was talking to an angel.<br><br>I never thought you also have horns.<br><br>They are gone now.<br><br>It will not grow anymore.<br>I cut them off.<br><br>Why did you cut them off?<br><br>Who knows you may<br>look better with them.<br><br>- What?<br>- A little horn.<br><br>Kiss me.<br><br>What?<br><br>What did I do to you?<br><br>You stole a kiss from me.<br><br>Fool.<br><br>I can return it to you.<br><br>Did you use magic on your scar?<br>Why does it looks like it's gone now?<br><br>No, I just hide it.

I am not perfect.<br><br>No you're not.<br>You' re human.<br><br>What would you say if<br>I ask you if I can court you?<br><br>Whatever happened to our contract?<br><br>Pia...<br><br>Seth, I only came here for a vacation.<br><br>I am leaving in a few days.<br><br>I know.<br><br>You won't like me once<br>you get to know me.<br><br>And my life is in Manila.<br><br>While yours is where life drifts you.<br><br>Wherever you wish.<br>Senseless, isn't it?<br><br>Yes, yes.<br><br>It will be a mistake for you to date me.<br><br>I am the worst guy you<br>could possibly date.<br><br>Yes!<br><br>But I'd still like to try.<br><br>If you would allow me to court you...<br><br>then meet me at the caldera<br>tonight at 8pm.<br><br>That is if it's okay with you.<br>No pressure.<br><br>You' re open?<br><br>Yes, actually, we are all shocked that<br>Sir Alex told us to open the taverna.<br><br>So my plan to go to the nude beach<br>with Josie is cancelled.<br><br>Mixed salad coming up!<br><br>Benjo hurry up and help me here.<br><br>Stavros!<br><br>- Hello! Selene.<br>- Pia! Have you killed Seth?<br><br>Worse!<br><br>I think I killed my<br>irritation towards him.<br><br>Oh my god!<br><br>- Does it mean you are falling for him?<br>- I guess so.<br><br>But I don't want to love him.<br><br>I know he's just going to hurt me<br>in the same way that he hurt all of you.<br><br>You know Alex.<br><br>People like us have to live<br>by our own rules.<br><br>But, if you fall in love and<br>let her into your heart.<br><br>Then, you' ll have to live by her rules.<br><br>You have to give up<br>control over your life for her.<br><br>Love changes people too much.<br><br>Until there is nothing left<br>of the person you used to be.<br><br>So why are you calling me?<br><br>I think you already know what to do.<br><br>But it is wrong, isn't it?<br><br>It' s wrong to love him, right?<br><br>Dad won't like him anyway, right?<br><br>Actually, you have a point.<br><br>- But...<br>- This is foolishness, right?<br><br>You know Pia, you shouldn't ask<br>about obvious stuff.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What if you don't like yourself<br>in the first place?<br><br>Maybe love is a good kind of change. Huh!<br><br>What's not to like?<br><br>She will try to change you when she should<br>just accept you for who you are.<br><br>First, it's the little things.<br><br>Your peer, your clothes, your friends.<br><br>Then she tells you that<br>it's still not enough.<br><br>I tell you Alex.<br><br>There is no freedom in love.<br><br>Your house is very pretty, guys!<br><br>Ahhh, Pi...<br>Oh my gosh.<br><br>Congratulations!<br><br>I am so glad you're here.<br><br>I am glad you got here.<br><br>- Of course.

It's a Saturday.<br><br>Since when did it stop you?<br><br>You know what,<br>we can give Pia a tour of our house.<br><br>- Pia, this is our house.<br>- Hey, I will join you.<br><br>Hey, where shall I put this down?<br><br>Just place it there.<br><br>- How beautiful!<br>- How are you now?<br><br>- It's okay.<br>- You still do not have anybody in tow?<br><br>If she has hardly have time<br>for us her friends...<br><br>how much more for her partner?<br><br>I can show you the master's bedroom.<br><br>This is the master's bedroom.<br><br>It is small but we really worked<br>on the design of this room.<br><br>Only now did I realize that the<br>color orange suits you well.<br><br>Orange!<br><br>You know, speaking of love life.<br><br>I saw Tristan Von Aufenberg.<br><br>Did he not court you?<br><br>Oh my god, Pi! Tristan's back.<br><br>Why don't you give him a call?<br><br>To know if he is still available<br>and interested in you.<br><br>And maybe go out on a date?<br><br>Actually my Dad hired him<br>as a consultant for my next project.<br><br>- Really?<br>- Oh my god, Pi!<br><br>That's perfect.<br>Go go go!<br><br>We planned to increase newspapers<br>and magazine ads by 25%.<br><br>This is more expensive but has a<br>wider reach than our brochures.<br><br>And hopefully by the end of the year...<br><br>the sales of Triant Towers can<br>catch up with the competition.<br><br>So...<br><br>what do you think, Tristan?<br><br>Ah... sorry Pia.<br><br>But I have to disagree with you on this one.<br><br>Now, you might be more successful if<br>your marketing strategy is experiential.<br><br>So, you need to think of<br>new ways to show...<br><br>and lead your clients to the condotel.<br><br>Then to our model units at Triant Towers.<br><br>I agree with you!<br><br>Everyone, thank you.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>Tristan, thank you.<br><br>You may all leave now, please.<br><br>Except for you Sophia.<br><br>Hello, Mom.

Another Diego Ocampo?<br><br>Have you not been burned?<br><br>Have you never learned?<br><br>Now that our real estate<br>business relies on you.<br><br>Sophia, don't you have any<br>respect left for yourself?<br><br>Dad!<br><br>Take it easy.<br>I think she gets the point.<br><br>I don't think she gets the point<br>at all, Gregory!<br><br>If she understands what she is doing...<br><br>she will not have any relation<br>with this guy!<br><br>Did she not just tell you?<br><br>Seth courted her<br>but she jilted him, that's it!<br><br>Why do you have to believe everything<br>that the news says...<br><br>about her than your own daughter.<br><br>Are you telling me<br>that all of this was made up?<br><br>All our employees saw it...<br><br>which she did not deny!<br><br>She said it's over, right?<br><br>She said the same thing 6 years ago!<br><br>We both thought it was over.<br><br>But what happened at the hospital?<br><br>We found out that she's still into Diego.<br><br>Dad.

			<p class="plot">In her bouts to help her daughter, Teresa accidently lands on a call center job where Regina is employed, giving her a chance (or is it really?) to rekindle her relationship with her daughter. In the call center, she meets people coming from different walks of life; fun-loving Richie, young-living Lolay, prim and proper Martin, and their monster Team Leader Vince.</p>

Tell Nils.<br><br>Half an hour, okay?<br><br>She looks like her mother<br>was cut out of her face.<br><br>That was in 1988.<br><br>Four months before her death.<br><br>Regina.<br><br>Yes, that was a long time ago.<br><br>And you'd like to really screw it up, hm?<br><br>I mean, I would, I would<br>relatively. You know that.<br><br>Training, training,<br>training. And at night<br><br>you watch a little bit<br>of TV for relaxation.<br><br>Oh, I think I would<br>come up with other things.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>I don't think that's bad.<br><br>You know, I've been<br>running here since I was five.<br><br>Good is of course a hard life. Always<br>on the go, life out of the suitcase.<br><br>In a hotel the whole<br>diet is a mess. But I<br><br>think you always have<br>to sacrifice something.<br><br>Sacrifice?<br><br>It's not possible without sacrifice.<br><br>You know, as an<br>ice skater we can't do<br><br>anything else because<br>we're obsessed, somehow.<br><br>Rababarababa.<br><br>Rababa.<br><br>Yes, obsessed.<br><br>We can't think of anything<br>else. We're obsessed.<br><br>Man, Nils, where have<br>you been all this time?<br><br>Good that you're coming. You<br>can free me from your brother.<br><br>Why? What's he doing?<br><br>I've got nothing.<br><br>He's totally obsessed.<br><br>That was obvious.<br><br>I just explained to him<br>what professional means.<br><br>Are you drunk?<br><br>Then I didn't really get it.<br><br>Oh, oh, no, no, no.<br><br>No.<br><br>You see, he's totally obsessed.<br><br>He's drunk and not obsessed.<br><br>He just can't stand it.<br><br>Then he's always so weird.<br><br>Come on, let's dance.<br><br>I think your brother can't right now.<br><br>He's totally crazy.<br><br>He has to come now. We have to dance.<br><br>Maybe you'd rather dance a<br>round with your honey horses.<br><br>What were their names again?<br><br>Werner and Bianca?<br><br>Theo and Luise.<br><br>Oops.<br><br>I shouldn't have talked about it.<br><br>Unfortunately, you can't.<br>They're already sleeping.<br><br>Hopefully.<br><br>What are your friends saying<br>about you being so obsessed?<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, them?<br><br>What friends?<br><br>They can still come.<br><br>We are the champions!<br><br>But we had that.<br><br>The Bund...<br><br>The Trade Union of North<br>German Merchants is called...<br><br>A little tip, start with H.<br><br>Show us the monster tip.<br><br>Friederike.<br><br>You can't concentrate,<br>you're talking all the time.<br><br>What?<br><br>I didn't even think about it.<br><br>Our little ice cream.<br><br>Yes, it's good.<br><br>Quiet!<br><br>But I can already tell who's provoking who.<br><br>Not him, red cap.<br><br>Every time.<br><br>We're home.<br><br>The ice cream is running.<br><br>Two minus.<br><br>Two minus? With the swab back?<br><br>That's a flat five.<br><br>But Nils, it could be that you<br>have no idea about women.<br><br>Or it could be that you're disabled.<br><br>Buried or shaved.<br><br>Doesn't matter, but not the expensive ones.<br><br>And now the photo is<br>leaking out, you shooter.<br><br>No.<br><br>So with this phone number,<br>there's nothing to say.<br><br>When I was your age, I got three<br>numbers from women per night.<br><br>Yes, as a medium.<br><br>That was before the accident.<br><br>But if you're so sure, call her.<br><br>Why call?<br><br>Oh, you don't understand, boy.<br><br>Women test men, women<br>give their numbers and test.<br><br>What do they test?<br><br>If you've got guts, if you're<br>a bottle or if you're brave.<br><br>If you let the three days<br>wait, you're screwed.<br><br>That's not my philosophy, Uwe.<br><br>You have to take it step by step.<br><br>With style.<br><br>You know what I think?<br><br>You didn't get a phone number.<br><br>You would have liked to, but you don't.<br><br>Yes. Not bad.<br><br>One minus, I'd say.<br><br>One minus? One plus!<br><br>Plus is not possible.<br><br>Hey, look!<br><br>No! It's about the time<br>for the open training.<br><br>But five days before the German<br>championship, there has to be a schedule.<br><br>Mr. Wiemeyer?<br><br>You're not being paid for making calls.<br><br>I know, sorry.<br><br>But try to get into the other ranks.<br><br>They say that Frederique<br>gets her arrogant tits in a row,<br><br>is absent because of some<br>tournament, and doesn't talk to anyone,<br><br>because she thinks she's better.<br><br>You're just jealous, you don't<br>have to take it so seriously.<br><br>I take it seriously.<br><br>Can't you try to take a<br>small step to the other ranks?<br><br>There are so many<br>nice people in your class.<br><br>Andi, for example, or Sonja.<br><br>Just dare, they don't bite.<br><br>I have to go now, unfortunately.<br><br>I still have to go to the training.<br><br>Frederique!<br><br>You isolate yourself with your way,<br>and in the end you end up alone.<br><br>They don't understand anything at all.<br><br>What did she say to you?<br><br>Doesn't matter now.<br><br>He's frozen.<br><br>Just believe it.<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>He was never frozen.<br><br>Happy New Year.<br><br>Come on, you lazy toad.<br><br>Always easy, Rike.<br><br>That's what happens when you get drunk.<br><br>I wasn't drunk.<br><br>Of course you were.<br><br>Otherwise you wouldn't have been so weird.<br><br>You know exactly what I mean.<br><br>It was pretty embarrassing how you acted.<br><br>It wasn't.<br><br>I was just talking.<br><br>That's all.<br><br>You didn't crash into her, did you?<br><br>Nils! Stop!<br><br>He's frozen.<br><br>You have no idea.<br><br>I am the ghost of the Waldsee!<br><br>I smell human flesh!<br><br>Hey.<br><br>You're dreaming all the time.<br><br>You're standing right next to her.<br><br>What are you imagining?<br><br>Yes, all the time.<br><br>What's wrong with dad today?<br><br>Dad fell in love.<br><br>What was that, Mara?<br><br>He didn't say anything.<br><br>It was Bernhard and Bianca.<br><br>No, Theo and Luise.<br><br>I was confused.<br><br>Do you have a problem?<br><br>No.<br><br>I didn't fall in love.<br><br>You're so childish for your age.<br><br>You're in love.<br><br>Look at me.<br><br>What?<br><br>Come on. If you're not in<br>love, you can look at me.<br><br>It's none of your business, you hear?<br><br>Well, I just mean it.<br><br>Because the number is too big for you.<br><br>I'll just keep it that way.<br><br>But at some point it's enough.<br><br>And then I'm gone.<br><br>Are you still there?<br><br>I was lucky.<br><br>You can play alone.<br><br>Oh, now daddy is angry.<br><br>But mum was right.<br><br>It's all too individual, too much to fight.<br><br>You have to be more self-confident.<br><br>I've told you a hundred times.<br><br>Tension...<br><br>In the middle of the<br>body during the lift. I know.<br><br>We have to pay more<br>attention to that next time, okay?<br><br>No.<br><br>Rieke, not we. Not we, you.<br><br>It's about your mistake, the<br>doctor can't do anything about it.<br><br>Dad, let's try it out tomorrow<br>at the training on site.<br><br>If we talk about it now...<br><br>It's just about a few<br>technical details anyway.<br><br>Rieke, you don't hear it,<br>it's not about technique.<br><br>It's about your overall expression.<br><br>Shall we see how something<br>like that works with Lydia Pascal?<br><br>No, we don't want to.<br><br>Sorry, but I still have homework to do.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>Can't we just do it tomorrow?<br><br>That's what I mean.<br><br>This is Pep, this is<br>Esprit, this is sexy, this<br><br>is international, this<br>is the opposite of you.<br><br>Nils, are you already sleeping?<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Hello.<br><br>I have to think about you all the time.<br><br>You've somehow totally<br>messed me up, because...<br><br>I thought you were<br>really cute the other day.<br><br>I think I'm a little crazy about you.<br><br>Is it bad?<br><br>No.<br><br>No, it's cheesy. Shit.<br><br>Hi, doll.<br><br>Guess who's here. Surprise.<br><br>You know, I have to go to Munich<br>the next few days anyway, and...<br><br>No.<br><br>I wanted to ask, because<br>you said we both...<br><br>So, if you have time, a little<br>meeting, at a cafe or at the cinema.<br><br>Ludia?<br><br>Vegetable?<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>Something's not right today.<br>You're totally unconcentrated.<br><br>Federica?<br><br>Why?<br><br>It's Friday as always.<br><br>No, it's not as always.<br><br>You pushed me off the plane.<br><br>Rieke, do you need a special invitation?<br><br>I have the feeling you're<br>really looking for a lot today.<br><br>How would it be if you<br>would sleep at night?<br><br>Let's not talk big,<br>let's just do it normally.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>Let's look at it first, otherwise<br>it won't make any sense.<br><br>So, you didn't get the pressure<br>point again, because the blind...<br><br>That doesn't help to look at the mistakes.<br><br>Let's just try it normally.<br>Nils, come on, please!<br><br>If you're going to be like this, we<br>don't need to go to the championship.<br><br>The judges will laugh at us.<br><br>But I did it exactly as<br>you explained it to me.<br><br>Unfortunately you didn't.<br><br>Otherwise it would have<br>looked better. There, look here.<br><br>Then you have to explain it to me better.<br><br>It's obvious that we're going<br>to Garmisch in three days.<br><br>Rieke, listen to me<br>when I'm talking to you.<br><br>I've been working my ass off for<br>years and you're playing the little diva.<br><br>Do you think it's okay?<br><br>No.<br><br>What have you achieved so far?<br><br>If it matters.<br><br>It's not that much, Rieke.<br><br>Dad.<br><br>Rieke.<br><br>Hello, listen to me.<br><br>Who's fooling around?<br><br>Are you serious?<br><br>Dad, stop it, please.<br><br>Get out of here, I'm<br>staying with your sister.<br><br>No, but that's totally unfair.<br><br>Oh, do you want to play the hero again?<br><br>No, but you can't do that.<br><br>We're still a family after all.<br><br>Well, if that's the case...<br><br>then do it.<br><br>I think you have to tighten the screw here.<br><br>Something is wobbling.<br><br>Yes, I'll do that later.<br><br>I don't know what's going on today.<br><br>Yes, Rieke. You know that.<br><br>You're under pressure.<br><br>And that's always been a problem for you.<br><br>You have to get through<br>it, no one else can help you.<br><br>Yes, I know.<br><br>But do you know what Nils said today?<br><br>Rieke, it doesn't help<br>that you keep pushing Nils.<br><br>It's your own fear.<br><br>He has to look us in the eye.<br><br>No one can help you. Not me and...<br><br>Nils almost can't.<br><br>If I overdo it, you have to tell me.<br>Then we have to draw the consequences.<br><br>What consequences?<br><br>I don't want to play the bad guy.<br><br>Then we combine Nils with another runner.<br><br>And with whom?<br><br>Only with Lydia.<br><br>She's looking for a new partner.<br><br>Because Hagen injured his knee.<br><br>There is a concrete offer on the<br>table and it's really about a lot of money.<br><br>I think it's a comedy, Rieke.<br><br>It's not a comedy.<br><br>Be quiet.<br><br>Isn't that funny?<br><br>It's because you don't have a sense for it.<br><br>No sense for what?<br><br>For romance.<br><br>If you know what it is.<br><br>No. Explain.<br><br>Well, if two people flirt, for example.<br><br>Attention, expert.<br><br>First you look deep into each other's eyes.<br><br>Then you pretend to find the<br>other person terribly boring.<br><br>And then you kiss.<br><br>Hurry up, please.<br><br>I'm not stupid, but<br>I'd invite her to dinner,<br><br>and fill her up with red<br>wine so she can't drive.<br><br>That's important. And then to the pleasure.<br><br>And always ready to take out the gum.<br><br>It wasn't so important before,<br>but the women of today...<br><br>Can you shut up for five minutes?<br><br>My God, you're so<br>confused. It'll never work.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Do you take out the gum?<br><br>Wine gum?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>No, eh, condoms.<br><br>Condoms.<br><br>The condom isn't for me, but the<br>young man back there doesn't dare to ask.<br><br>So...<br><br>Don't listen to him.<br>He's mentally retarded.<br><br>What am I?<br><br>Ah! Help!<br><br>Ah! My ear!<br><br>Well, chilling again?<br><br>Pretty shitty when you're<br>sitting here all alone, huh?<br><br>What are you doing this afternoon?<br><br>Why?<br><br>Well, I'm going to the<br>cafe to play some football.<br><br>I can't. I have training.<br><br>Well, you can't always train.<br><br>No, you can't.<br><br>And after that?<br><br>I've already made an<br>appointment with someone.<br><br>And...<br><br>when else?<br><br>No, I don't think so, to be honest.<br><br>What can I say, Rieke?<br><br>Good, nice, very gentle.<br><br>So, it's possible.<br><br>And don't give up now.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>You're slurping.<br><br>And Nils, look at her now!<br><br>Do you have to go again?<br><br>Yes, Uwe had a problem with his e-roller.<br><br>Probably the batteries are all dead again.<br><br>And when will you come back?<br><br>Why?<br><br>It can't take that long.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Nils?<br><br>You smell good.<br><br>I have to go.<br><br>He's standing outside and can't leave.<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Have fun?<br><br>It's work, not fun.<br><br>You know what I hate about small towns?<br><br>That people stare at you like in a zoo.<br><br>It's because of your advertising.<br><br>I don't understand you<br>when you talk so quietly.<br><br>It's because of your advertising<br>that's hanging around here.<br><br>I think it's pretty good.<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>It must be a terrible feeling when you're<br>hanging around like this in the city.<br><br>You get used to it.<br><br>I'm sorry, I have to go.<br><br>Really? Can you still drive?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>I'm just going to<br>Munich, it's a nice place.<br><br>Yeah, probably.<br><br>Tell me, what do you think of my offer?<br><br>Well, it's interesting. I just<br>have to be with my family.<br><br>You know, my sister.<br><br>Do you want to have a drink with me?<br><br>Do you want to have a drink with me?<br><br>Hey, I'll invite you, no problem.<br><br>== You're going to go to bed,<br>aren't you? == I am. I'm exhausted.<br><br>== You have to go to bed, though.<br>== I really have to go back today.<br><br>Tell me, what are you planning to do?<br><br>== Are you drunk<br>again? == Just a little bit.<br><br>I think that's pretty unprofessional,<br>right before the championship.<br><br>But I'm not interested.<br><br>I wanted to tell you something.<br>Something important.<br><br>What kind of secret<br>negotiations are you having?<br><br>Are you going crazy?<br><br>You're having secret<br>negotiations behind my back.<br><br>I know exactly what's going on.<br><br>Dad told me everything.<br><br>These Lydia's are looking<br>for new runners and...<br><br>You're being hysterical.<br><br>This Hergen has injured himself<br>and you're supposed to replace him.<br><br>You're a traitor.<br><br>That's not what it's about.<br><br>Don't you get it?<br><br>You're sniffing my private life.<br><br>It's two days before the<br>German Championships.<br><br>You're negotiating with<br>this pussy, you stupid ass.<br><br>I don't care when I'll meet her.<br><br>You don't give a shit.<br><br>You don't stand a chance with her.<br><br>She's just wiggling around and you<br>think she wants something from you.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>You don't stand a chance with her.<br><br>Because you're such a little pimple.<br><br>I'm still going to feel really bad for her.<br><br>Can you give me the butter, please?<br><br>Please, please, please, the butter.<br><br>Please, please, please, the butter.<br><br>Tell me, is there<br>something eaten out of you?<br><br>Me?<br><br>This woman, your teacher,<br>oh God, what's her name?<br><br>Mrs. Neumann.<br><br>Oh, red cap.<br><br>What?<br><br>That's her nickname.<br><br>Yeah, whatever, she wants me<br>to come to my parents' tonight.<br><br>But I don't like that at all.<br><br>We'll see each other later.<br><br>Don't be too late, this is a<br>final rule, just as a reminder.<br><br>Did you hear that, little boy?<br><br>Rieke! Are you crazy?<br><br>Did you hurt yourself?<br><br>He's crazy, he just let me go!<br><br>I didn't do anything. She's<br>just limping, as always.<br><br>It hurts.<br><br>Now you two, pull yourselves together!<br><br>It's not going to be like the horse<br>anyway. We can stay at home.<br><br>Stop talking nonsense! You stay in<br>your circle and Rieke, tighten your hips!<br><br>Is it really that bad?<br><br>I don't know if you really appreciate<br>your daughter. I see that she's suffering.<br><br>And that's partly because<br>she barely has time to<br><br>think about anything<br>else than running on ice.<br><br>But now you're getting mixed up<br>in the questions of the relationship.<br><br>No, I mean, it's impossible to separate.<br><br>I'm just starting to understand.<br><br>What?<br><br>With the red cap, the hair, nothing!<br><br>Nothing!<br><br>Mr. Wehmeyer, you're overreaching<br>your daughter. You're isolating her.<br><br>I mean, it's certainly not easy<br>for you as an only child father.<br><br>Now, listen to me, Mrs. Lahn.<br><br>Have you ever heard of goals? Of visions?<br><br>That there's something in life that's<br>more important than anything else?<br><br>That's high-performance sports.<br><br>It can be heaven or<br>hell. It's victory or defeat.<br><br>And in any case, it's better<br>than being poisoned all<br><br>day and hanging out in<br>front of some video games.<br><br>And as long as you<br>haven't understood that,<br><br>please spare me your<br>pedagogical nonsense.<br><br>I'm sorry about earlier.<br><br>But you know, maybe it's better if<br>we don't run together any longer.<br><br>The championship is still<br>on and then game over.<br><br>You used to pee in my bathtub.<br><br>Can you pee somewhere else?<br><br>Not that long ago. Take care.<br><br>I'd put on something.<br><br>It's very cold, you know.<br><br>You're quite a bright boy, you know.<br><br>Has anyone ever told you how<br>silly it looks with your mini-tits?<br><br>Is someone getting threatened?<br><br>Leave it.<br><br>Are you afraid?<br><br>Oh my God, the little<br>baby is really afraid.<br><br>You don't need to be afraid.<br><br>No.<br><br>Come on, little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Little baby.<br><br>Oh, yes, kiss me.<br><br>Shut the door.<br><br>Kiss me.<br><br>Not so gently.<br><br>Don't be afraid.<br><br>You're kissing like a pig.<br><br>You're crazy.<br><br>But Rico has to eat something too.<br><br>Otherwise you'll collapse us tomorrow.<br><br>Come on, one for daddy.<br><br>What's up with her today?<br><br>Is she having a bad day or what?<br><br>Who should know?<br><br>I have a pair like that,<br>Friederike and Nils Wehmeyer.<br><br>You have the big chance.<br><br>Basically, the first place is clear.<br><br>You can take the lead.<br><br>In this new situation,<br><br>is the pressure a little different?<br><br>Has the pressure changed?<br><br>The pressure is always there.<br><br>But the preliminary race went optimally.<br><br>We systematically prepared for tomorrow.<br><br>Oh, I've sorted out the<br>thing with the ice rink.<br><br>Just send Nils over, we'll check him out.<br><br>I can go for a walk with Lydia.<br><br>Peter, I still don't feel<br>like talking to you about it.<br><br>Well, but Werner Wehmeyer can be home soon.<br><br>My God, are you sensitive today?<br><br>Of course I'm sensitive when<br>you're hanging on to me like a man.<br><br>Could it be that you're<br>running away from something?<br><br>Yes, from you.<br><br>Peter, I have two children.<br><br>You can't just tear them apart like that.<br><br>It has to do with family.<br><br>Yes, yes, family.<br><br>Back then you didn't even know<br>how to wrap your own children.<br><br>But you...<br><br>No, but I'm not talking nonsense.<br><br>Look, if someone raised<br>his children professionally,<br><br>then you.<br><br>There was no aura.<br><br>You learn to jump by falling.<br><br>You said you were tough and consistent.<br><br>That's what sports require.<br><br>Yes, but I don't expect<br>anything else from you.<br><br>If Lydia does it tomorrow, with Nils,<br><br>I'll be the first to congratulate you.<br><br>But if not, then you'll<br>have to make a decision.<br><br>A professional decision.<br><br>Tough and consistent.<br><br>Please turn off the TV and go to bed.<br><br>That's no use.<br><br>Liga, it's half past two.<br><br>Please go to bed.<br><br>You like to eat, don't you?<br><br>Finally you're here! How do you look?<br><br>Now tell me!<br><br>Get lost!<br><br>You want to fumble again?<br><br>Leave me alone!<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>Who started it?<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>We won't make it.<br><br>Don't cry, Rick.<br><br>I'm here.<br><br>Everything's as usual.<br><br>It's not as usual.<br><br>It's all over.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Now it's all about here and now.<br><br>You have the audience<br>on your side. I noticed<br><br>that when I walked<br>in. They're behind you.<br><br>Did you catch a cold?<br><br>Not so dramatic.<br><br>That's because you're half-naked.<br><br>Forget it. It's no use saying anything.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Let's go. Full speed ahead.<br><br>Look at me, Rieke.<br><br>So, let's go. Come on.<br><br>It's not decided yet.<br><br>It's just a test.<br><br>Think about how it went.<br><br>You can do it.<br><br>You will make it. And always<br>think about the rubbers.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Are you crazy?<br><br>You could have...<br><br>I have time today, by the way.<br><br>Because you said you could<br>have coffee or something.<br><br>Psst! We don't want to disturb<br>you. We just want to listen.<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>Well?

My mom was a Delta.<br><br>So, what, she, like,<br>forced you into it or something?<br><br>No.<br><br>She died when I was little.<br><br>It was just me and my dad.<br><br>So I thought that becoming a Delta<br>would be something to remember her by.<br><br>That's sweet.<br><br>I mean, I want to throw up.<br><br>But it's sweet. Seriously.<br><br>Don't think I don't see you two<br>sitting over here snickering<br><br>or laughing or whatever.<br><br>You do know that those words<br>mean the same thing, right?<br><br>What I do know is that<br>you are two of the sorriest pledges<br><br>I have ever seen in my life.<br><br>And if you want a hope in hell<br>of getting into this sorority,<br><br>you better get it together.<br><br>Well, let's take one<br>for Mom and my studies.<br><br>This is a mess.<br><br>- This happened last night?<br>- Right about then.<br><br>We don't get many eyewitnesses out here<br>in the middle of the night,<br><br>which, I'm sure, was the point.<br><br>I'm not gonna candy coat this<br>for you, Sheriff.<br><br>If this fence was down for even an hour,<br><br>it's entirely possible that<br>some of the crocs escaped.<br><br>I mean, there's a chance<br>we can track some of them, but...<br><br>Then what are we waiting for?<br><br>Well, I mean, you obviously<br>know a lot about breeding.<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>That came out wrong.<br><br>Let me clarify that.<br><br>Aroostook Station Wildlife.<br><br>Hey, Sheryl, it's Tully.<br>I'm out here at Black Lake,<br><br>just trying to take my foot<br>out of my mouth.<br><br>You do that a lot, Tully.<br><br>If you could do me a solid<br>and get Falmouth on the line<br><br>and have them send over<br>all the transponder numbers<br><br>for the crocs they tagged<br>out here on their last survey,<br><br>that would be great.<br><br>And if you could make it snappy,<br>I would be very happy.<br><br>We could have a very serious situation<br>on our hands here.<br><br>- I don't know, I'll pass it on.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Yep. Thanks.<br>- Tully, what about that raise I...<br><br>Okay, bye, bye. Bye. Bye.<br><br>What I was saying earlier is that<br><br>any crocs that were born<br>after they were tagged<br><br>aren't gonna have any transponders.<br><br>So we're gonna have to hunt<br>the old-fashioned way.<br><br>And if we're gonna do that,<br><br>it's gonna take a lot more than<br>that peashooter to stop 'em.<br><br>Don't you worry about me.<br><br>If there's one thing I'm good at,<br>it's stopping crocodiles.<br><br>So I've heard.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Here's a list of all the transponders<br>that they tagged the crocs with.<br><br>Looks like a lot.<br><br>Yeah, but this is not right.<br><br>This is last week's readout. Hold on.<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>The whole system went down.<br><br>Is that normal?<br><br>Well, it's never gone down on me before,<br>so to speak.<br><br>There's a first time<br>for everything, I guess.<br><br>- That's kind of convenient timing.<br>- Not really.<br><br>Well, I mean, a bizarre accident<br>blows a hole in our security gate<br><br>around the same time<br>the tracking system goes down.<br><br>We don't even know<br>how many crocs have escaped, if any.<br><br>True, true.<br>We don't know how many escaped,<br><br>but we do know where they're going.<br><br>Check this out. Pull up this map.<br><br>All right. This is us.<br><br>And here's Black Lake.<br><br>Now I'm willing to bet<br>they've probably consumed<br><br>most of the lake's resources, so,<br><br>the crocs are gonna be headed<br>toward the nearest source of ready food,<br><br>which is right there.<br><br>Clear Lake.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Where do you want us to start?<br><br>Start in there.<br><br>That's where we found him<br>the first time.<br><br>If we're lucky,<br>he'll be drinking his way through<br><br>that money we gave him.<br><br>You two wait out here.<br><br>Try to blend in with the locals.<br><br>I'll go around the back.<br><br>What's up?<br><br>What's up?<br><br>Come on, Beth, answer the phone, please.<br><br>Look, just try to relax.<br><br>You know, she's probably out<br>having some fun with friends.<br><br>Besides, we don't even know<br>if the crocs did escape<br><br>or even if they made it to Clear Lake.<br><br>Look, I'm not gonna be able to relax<br>until I know my daughter is safe.<br><br>So, I'm gonna go look for her.<br><br>We're working here, Tull.<br><br>Once that fence is fixed, your lake is safe.<br>I can't say the same thing about my daughter.<br><br>So, I'm gonna go try and find her,<br>you can come or not.<br><br>I'm coming!<br><br>I was never here.<br><br>You got it, boss.<br><br>- Hey, buddy, what can I get you?<br>- I'm looking for Jim Bickerman.<br><br>Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim who?<br><br>I'm still having a hard time<br>with that last name.<br><br>Bickersteen?<br><br>Bickerman.

Did that hurt?<br><br>Come on, Jim.<br>We still have business to discuss.<br><br>Let me help you up.<br><br>Did you see that?<br><br>I think I got me a lawsuit here.<br><br>- He's actually kind of cute.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You ready?<br><br>- Born ready.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Ladies, Andrew is gonna<br>give Hannah here...<br><br>- Heather.<br>- Close enough.<br><br>A show to remember.<br><br>Damn, it's cold.<br><br>- I'm gonna go up front.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Baby, you know tops are<br>optional on my boat.<br><br>Does that line really work?<br><br>Well, I am the captain.<br><br>You handle the throttle.<br><br>Hit it!<br><br>Yeah, baby.<br><br>Let's go over there.<br><br>What? I'm serious. You're so much hotter<br>than the other girls.<br><br>How about a little suck face?<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Stop! Stop the boat!<br><br>Why? What's wrong?<br><br>He's gone. He's gone!<br><br>Something attacked him.<br>I think a giant alligator or something!<br><br>Yeah, yeah, he's probably joking around.<br><br>- I'll circle back and pick him up.<br>- I'm sorry.<br><br>I'm allergic to water.<br><br>He'll be okay, all right?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>What the...<br><br>Very funny, Andrew!<br><br>That was a $200 rope.<br><br>Maybe we should get back to the beach.<br><br>I can't leave Andrew<br>in the middle of the lake,<br><br>joke or no joke.<br><br>Not again. Cut it out.<br><br>That's not funny.<br>We've seen this before.<br><br>Andrew?<br><br>I did not give them permission<br>to get out of the water!<br><br>Oh, my God, they're gone!<br><br>Melissa!<br><br>Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!<br>What do we do? Tiffani!<br><br>I don't think we can outrun them!<br><br>- God!<br>- Wait! I have an idea!<br><br>What?<br><br>Help me!<br><br>No!<br><br>Need I tell you that you're going<br>just a tad over the speed limit?<br><br>- Write me a ticket.<br>- Don't tempt me.<br><br>Ferguson, you out there?<br><br>Come in.<br><br>Ferguson, come in.<br><br>- Excuse me, bro. Official police business.<br>- Ferguson.<br><br>- Just, just one minute. Thanks.<br>- Okay.<br><br>This is Ferguson. Who's this?<br><br>It's your mother, Ferguson.<br><br>I need you to get out to the Clear<br>Lake Marina and get everybody out.<br><br>The lake is officially closed.<br><br>Blame it on red algae<br>or brain-eating amoebas.<br><br>I don't really care.<br>Just don't let anybody<br><br>hear you say the word "Crocodile."<br><br>We don't need to start a panic.<br>Am I clear?<br><br>Roger that, Sheriff.<br><br>Ix-nay on the ocodile-cray.<br><br>Where's my...<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Come on!

You can't come in this car.<br><br>- Why?<br>- I don't like your bikini.<br><br>That's it. We're leaving.<br><br>God, can you believe it?<br>I left the keys on the beach.<br><br>You mind going back and getting them,<br>big sister?<br><br>What? Are you nuts?<br><br>Come on, come on, get out of here!<br><br>Why aren't they leaving?<br><br>Go! Go away!<br><br>Yeah, that'll work.<br>Just tell them to leave.<br><br>I'm getting out of here!<br><br>No! Cassie, no!<br><br>No!<br><br>She's not gonna make it.<br><br>Better her than me.<br><br>- We got to help her.<br>- I volunteer...<br><br>- Her.<br>- Why her?<br><br>It's not like she's gonna get in anyway.<br><br>Do you try to be a bitch<br>or does it just come naturally?<br><br>Our only hope is Tiff's car.<br><br>Okay? We go on three!<br><br>One, two, three!<br><br>No!<br><br>I got you! I got you.<br><br>I got you.<br><br>We got to distract them.<br><br>- Who's got something we can use?<br>- Like what?<br><br>I need a can of hair spray.<br>Something flammable.<br><br>How about spray tanner?<br><br>Somebody must have left it there.<br><br>That'll work. Who's got a lighter?<br><br>Guilty as charged.<br><br>Help! Help!<br><br>They're gonna... They're gonna...<br><br>No, they're not. It's okay.<br><br>When I say the word,<br>just be ready to run, okay?<br><br>Wait a second, I'm in charge here.<br>I say the word.<br><br>I'm listening!<br><br>Hey! Over here!<br><br>Now?<br><br>Now! Now! Now!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>I'm not getting a signal.<br><br>We must be out of range.<br><br>It's a snake skin.<br><br>One of them is molting.<br><br>It's too big for the males.<br><br>It's come from the female.<br><br>She may be ready to lay her eggs.<br><br>- We know one thing for sure.<br>- Which is what?<br><br>She's still growing.<br><br>Yeah, like she wasn't<br>big enough already.<br><br>Move out!<br><br>I'm fine.<br><br>Just fine. Thanks for asking.<br><br>Okay, sorry. Sorry.<br><br>People of the visitors' center,<br>I need you to leave the premises right away.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to panic.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>There is no need to panic.<br>Everything will be okay.<br><br>By order of the Aroostook<br>County sheriff,<br><br>I need you to all remove your vehicles<br>and exit in a calm and orderly manner.<br><br>There's no need for pushing and shoving.<br><br>Get out of the way, nerd boy!<br><br>Be polite, people!<br><br>This is a major emergency! Run!<br>Your life may depend on it!<br><br>Stop. Stop!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Sheriff...<br><br>What the hell is it?<br><br>It's crocodile prints.<br><br>That tracker of yours<br>showing anything around here?<br><br>No, no, no. It's still not working.<br>I left it in the truck.<br><br>That's weird.<br>Where the hell did that thing go?<br><br>Do something!<br><br>Working on it!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where you going?<br><br>Damn!<br><br>Sheriff!<br><br>Sheriff!<br><br>Sheriff, stop! What are you doing?<br><br>I'm going after the snake!<br><br>Hell, no.<br><br>I'm not about to become<br>part of the food chain.<br><br>I'm going back to the truck<br>to find my daughter.<br><br>What?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on, this way.<br><br>I'm coming. I'm coming.<br>I got a bum knee.<br><br>Sheriff, this is Ferguson.<br><br>Sheriff, you copy?<br><br>Yeah, I hear you, Ferguson. Go.<br><br>This is Ferguson.<br><br>I know, Ferguson. You just radio-ed me.<br><br>Yeah, I just wanted you to know<br>that the visitors' center is secure<br><br>and I've locked all the perimeter gates.<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>By any chance you come across<br>a group of sorority girls out there?<br><br>Negative, Sheriff.<br>Just a bunch of families.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Did somebody else go missing?<br><br>I'm with Tull. Meet me on the fire road.<br>We got another problem.<br><br>Does it involve a C-R-O-C?<br><br>Now, Ferguson!<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Damn it! Still no answer.<br><br>I've never seen anything<br>like that in my life.<br><br>No, me neither.<br><br>I mean, it... It had to be an anaconda.<br><br>The green anaconda, that's the largest<br>species in recorded history.<br><br>That thing wasn't just large, Tull.<br>It was, it was ginormous.<br><br>I know. I saw it. I can't explain it.<br><br>I mean, I've heard stories<br>of these snakes<br><br>getting to be 50 or more feet long,<br>eating cattle and people.<br><br>But this is deep down in the jungles,<br>and they're just legends.<br><br>Maybe not.<br><br>Well, even if it's not a story,<br>they're indigenous to the Amazon.<br><br>What the hell are they doing here?<br><br>It had to have come from somewhere.<br><br>It had to be a person<br>who brought it here.<br><br>Great minds think alike.<br><br>How did it get so big?<br><br>I don't know. That's the least<br>of my worries at this point.<br><br>You need more?<br><br>My daughter is still out there.<br><br>And any of these snakes<br>could be out there with her.<br><br>And here I thought the crocs were bad.<br><br>We can't just stay here.<br><br>Maybe we can. I mean,<br>someone will figure out we're missing<br><br>and send someone to find us. Right?<br><br>That could take days.<br><br>We'll starve to death.<br><br>Trust me, some of you girls<br>could stand to lose a little weight.<br><br>Oh, my God. Do I have to do everything?<br><br>Switch with me.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>You were serious about stealing cars?<br><br>All better. Let's go.<br><br>How'd you learn to do that?<br><br>When my dad wouldn't lend me his car.<br><br>And that is why being a DG<br>is not in your future.<br><br>How will my life go on?<br><br>Drive!<br><br>- I don't know...<br>- Where are we going?<br><br>Oh, my God, watch out for that tree!<br><br>My goodness! My goodness!<br><br>Damn it!<br><br>Back up. There has to be another way.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>What are you waiting for, Tiff?<br>Just drive!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>Everybody out! Now!<br><br>- Get out! Get out!<br>- I can't go out there!<br><br>I can't!<br><br>Wait! Where's Jennifer?<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>- She's still inside!<br>- What?<br><br>We have to get her out! Oh, my God.<br><br>Hey, get off of there! Get off!<br><br>- Yeah, that's smart! Piss off the giant snake!<br>- Somebody help me!<br><br>Somebody help me! Someone!<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>Hey, you did everything<br>somebody like you was willing to do.<br><br>What am I going to tell my dad?<br><br>He just bought me that car!<br><br>If something happens<br>and I don't make it, do me a favor.<br><br>Kick her ass.<br><br>First on my bucket list.<br><br>- What is it?<br>- There's something out there.<br><br>It's not showing up on here.<br><br>Maybe the transmission<br>got damaged somehow.<br><br>Or maybe it's something else.<br><br>Don't shoot it. It's a federal offense.<br><br>What's it doing?<br><br>Hunting.<br><br>Hunting what?<br><br>Us.<br><br>The hell with this!<br><br>He's dead.<br><br>Let's get moving.<br>She could lay her eggs any time.<br><br>We can't just leave him here like that.<br><br>We can't take him with us.<br>He'll just slow us down.<br><br>He knew what he was signing up for.<br>He have a family?<br><br>A sister.<br><br>Send flowers. Let's go.<br><br>You do realize she's a sociopath, right?<br><br>It had crossed my mind.<br><br>Any new leads on the sorority girls?<br><br>- Space, Ferguson.<br>- No, sir... Sorry.<br><br>You guys are covered in blood.<br><br>There are only really two<br>usable beaches along the shoreline.<br><br>Everything else is just too rocky,<br>too many trees.<br><br>There's one along this path<br><br>and another one round back<br>all the way over to the other side.<br><br>That one's more popular<br>with the local teenagers.<br><br>If you, if you get my meaning.<br><br>- Show me.<br>- Okay. Yeah.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Beth!<br><br>What the hell happened here?<br><br>Bethany!<br><br>- I'm gonna go check the lake.<br>- What...<br><br>I'm just gonna...<br><br>- Ferguson! Let's go!<br>- Just gotta get my gun.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What's an abandoned boat doing here?<br><br>Ferguson, go check the boat out, okay?<br><br>We're gonna check the shoreline.<br>Let's go.<br><br>What the...<br><br>I need you to focus.<br>Okay, I'm gonna ask you again.<br><br>What happened on the boat?<br><br>Who else was on the boat with you?<br>Think.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Andrew was wakeboarding and...<br><br>Okay, but who else was there, all right?<br>I'm looking for someone. Okay?<br><br>I'm looking for a girl, 5'4", blond hair,<br>blue eyes, named Bethany.<br><br>Bethany Tull.<br><br>- Her name is Bethany!<br>- Okay, relax, Tully, okay?<br><br>I don't remember any other girls<br>on the beach!<br><br>Are you here for rush week?<br>Are you part of the sorority?<br><br>I'm looking for my daughter, damn it!<br><br>- Tully, come here!<br>- I told you I don't remember!<br><br>Take it easy, Tully.<br><br>Can't you see<br>that the girl is hysterical?<br><br>You're not gonna get anything from her,<br>not now.<br><br>- I know. I just... I'm sorry. I lost it.<br>- It's all right.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Everything will be okay. I promise.<br>I promise. It'll all be okay.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>Get her to the hospital, would you?<br>Okay?<br><br>Okay. Hey.<br><br>Hey. Now let's go find<br>your daughter, okay?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I got something.<br><br>Signal's pretty weak.<br><br>She's far.<br><br>How big is this lake?<br><br>Well, this is about as wide as she gets.<br><br>Goes down that way another click or so<br>before it hits the Clear Lake Dam.<br><br>How do we get there?<br><br>Well, let's see.<br><br>Well, we could take the roads<br>or go back over land.<br><br>There's a boat. That'll do.<br><br>I believe that's a tad too small, miss.<br><br>I'm sure you've heard that<br>more than once in your life.<br><br>I don't think that belongs to us,<br>Ms. Murdoch.<br><br>I don't care what you think.<br>Now are you coming?<br><br>Or are you giving me my money back?<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>Something crushed it like a tin can.<br><br>There's no way a crocodile<br>could do this.<br><br>You and I both know it wasn't a croc.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>I'm gonna find my daughter<br>before that snake does.<br><br>Just another day at the office.<br><br>Lower your throttle, you goon.<br>You're going too fast.<br><br>Don't listen to him. Speed up!<br><br>That's a hell of a lot of wake.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, a big wake, lots of splashing,<br><br>tends to attract crocs.<br><br>I got bigger things to worry about<br>than crocodiles, Mr. Bickerman.<br><br>Yeah. That's what you think.<br><br>What the hell was that?<br><br>We hit something.<br><br>Or something hit us.<br><br>I don't have time for this. Move!<br><br>Can you even drive a boat, lady?<br><br>What are you doing? We have to go back.<br>We have to go back.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Murdoch, you bitch!<br><br>- Help!<br>- Hey! Turn the boat around.<br><br>We got to go back and get him!<br><br>We're not going back.<br><br>You want to save him?<br>Feel free to go for a swim.<br><br>That's it. I've had it.<br>I'm taking a break.<br><br>We should just keep moving.<br><br>I don't care what you do.<br><br>I need a minute to catch my breath.<br><br>No, no, she's right.<br>We should just stop.<br><br>Let's just stand here<br>so the giant snake can catch us.<br><br>I don't think it followed us.<br><br>What we need to do<br>is find our way back to the main road.<br><br>Get your weasel ass up and keep moving.<br><br>The only way you're getting into<br>this sorority is over my dead body.<br><br>Dare to dream.<br><br>All right, girls. Two minutes.<br><br>And then we try to find the main road.<br><br>Just keep an eye out.<br><br>Crocodiles, snakes,<br><br>who knows what else<br>could be out here with us?<br><br>Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.<br><br>Brings me back to my wonderful,<br>yet nightmarish, childhood.<br><br>Anybody else hear that?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Oh, my God, something's out there.<br><br>Anyone want to bet it's not a cute,<br>little, scary-ass munchkin?<br><br>Maybe it's a search party.<br><br>Maybe they're looking for me.<br><br>Whatever it is, it's coming this way.<br><br>If it is a search party,<br>they're not leaving without me.<br><br>I didn't think there were any crocodiles<br>in Clear Lake!<br><br>Well, there's your search party.<br><br>That's not funny! What do I do?<br><br>Just don't move.<br><br>Don't move.<br><br>No! Nobody messes with a DG sister!<br><br>Oh, my God!<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>- Run!<br>- Oh, my God!<br><br>- Oh, my God, run!<br>- Beth!<br><br>Dad! Dad!<br><br>Oh, my God. I thought I lost you.<br><br>I knew you'd come for me.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>I'm gonna go home and reenact that<br>to my dad and evil stepmom.<br><br>Listen, this is real sweet and all,<br>but we'd better get moving.<br><br>I can't argue with that.<br><br>- Come on, let's go. Let's go.<br>- Okay.<br><br>All right, Beach.<br><br>You've had that look on your face<br>since we got off the boat.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Nothing you need to worry about.<br><br>I'm putting my mission<br>and my life in your hands.<br><br>If you have a problem,<br>then hell yes, I need to worry.<br><br>I didn't like him any more than you did,<br>but we could've pulled him out of the water.<br><br>No one around here is gonna miss<br>Jim Bickerman, believe me.<br><br>Besides, he's probably fine.<br><br>There wasn't that much left of him.<br><br>He was a loose end.<br><br>He was right. You are a sociopath.<br><br>I'm not a sociopath, Mr. Beach.<br><br>I'm a person trying to protect<br>her father's legacy.<br><br>He spent most of his life<br>perfecting the Blood Orchid serum<br><br>and I intend to finish what he started.<br><br>Make no mistakes.<br><br>I will gladly sacrifice anyone<br>or anything that gets in my way.<br><br>Including you.<br><br>Nice to know where I stand.<br><br>Just keep doing your job<br>and you'll be fine.<br><br>This was such a gigantic mistake.<br><br>I should have pledged Omega Kappa.<br><br>How much further is it?<br><br>This is not my neck<br>of the woods, I am lost.<br><br>Relax, Tully, I know where we're going.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Sheriff, this is Ferguson. You copy?<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>Sheriff, can you hear me?<br><br>I copy, Ferguson.<br><br>Is that you?<br><br>I give up. I give up.<br><br>According to this signal,<br>she's right here somewhere.<br><br>We've been flushing them out<br>toward the choke point.<br><br>There's no way out.<br><br>I'm telling you.<br><br>She's right here.<br><br>What do you mean, right here?<br><br>The only thing I'm seeing out here<br>is you, me and Mr. Happy.<br><br>I'm telling you, she's right here.<br><br>Where is it?<br><br>- That's not her.<br>- What do you mean, that's not her?<br><br>That's the male.<br><br>Then where the hell is she?<br><br>Don't shoot it!<br><br>Damn!<br><br>You'll kill him if you shoot my snake!<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I told you I wasn't<br>gonna let you kill it,<br><br>which is what I'll do to you<br>if you get in my way.<br><br>Over there.<br><br>Don't you ever do that again.<br><br>Now, come on!<br><br>What the hell was that?<br><br>I don't know, but it's big. Let's move.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Wait a second!<br><br>We need the tracking device<br>and the case, you idiot!<br><br>And I'll take my gun back.<br><br>This is Ferguson, over.<br><br>Lot of movement down here.<br>Crocs and snakes, over.<br><br>Ferguson, where the hell are you?<br><br>I'm in a back path somewhere<br>trying to find one of the crocs.<br><br>And I think I can hear something.<br><br>Can you hear this, Ferguson?<br><br>You're hearing us. You're hearing us!<br><br>- Turn around!<br>- What?<br><br>Got it.<br><br>No grip on my shoes.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Okay, got it.<br><br>- All right?<br>- Okay.<br><br>Nobody move!<br><br>Ready to fill your freezer?<br><br>You got a full clip?<br><br>Never leave home without it.<br><br>Hey, how dare you point<br>your guns at my snake?<br><br>I'm the sheriff, lady.<br>Who the hell are you?<br><br>I don't care who you are.<br>You're not killing my snake!<br><br>You see, I'm the one who says<br>who kills who and what around here.<br><br>Right now, you're on my list.<br><br>This is a controlled animal reserve.<br><br>Drop your gun<br>and tell your henchmen to stand down.<br><br>Let me just educate you a little bit.<br><br>Those snakes are the property<br>of the Wexel Corporation.<br><br>You kill them and I am gonna sue<br>the town of Lake Placid into bankruptcy.<br><br>It's gonna be a little tricky, don't you think,<br>to attract tourists to a ghost town?<br><br>Now, I'm gonna put him down<br>for a little nap.<br><br>My extraction team is gonna<br>bring them back to the lab.<br><br>And you and your little<br>college field trip<br><br>can do whatever you want<br>with your crocodiles.<br><br>Beach.<br><br>Extraction Team, this is Black Lake recovery.<br>Get ready for extraction.<br><br>Read you loud and clear. We're here.<br><br>Then again, Beach, kill the damn crocs.<br><br>Don't let them kill the male.<br><br>What the hell was that?<br><br>After everything I've seen today,<br>nothing would surprise me.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Except that.<br><br>She's here!<br><br>That is one big-ass snake.<br><br>That's my girl!<br><br>On my coordinates, gentlemen,<br>prepare for snake extraction.<br><br>Roger that. We have eyes on you.<br><br>That's okay, baby.<br><br>You will all be home soon.<br><br>Looks like your extraction team<br>just got extracted.<br><br>- Ferguson!<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>Get my daughter<br>and her friends to safety.<br><br>I'm not leaving you here.<br><br>I'll be fine.<br><br>- Just go. Go!<br>- Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go.<br><br>And if things go south,<br>get 'em the hell out of here.<br><br>Yes, sir.

mean, we are the only sort of,<br><br>you know, four grand dames<br><br>that have actually<br>sort of stuck together.<br><br>We have to survive<br>and we have to survive together.<br><br>And so many groups<br><br>who are on the brink<br>of the world's riches<br><br>don't realise that.<br><br>They suddenly think<br>they're too big for the group<br><br>and they disappear off.<br><br>And they throw

These fuckers.<br><br>Romeo, what's with all the yelling?<br><br>Nothing. No.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>What's the story between Don Tasio<br>and my old man? Was there a problem?<br><br>Ah.<br><br>Well,<br><br>a long time ago, Tasio<br><br>was chasing after the prettiest<br>little girl in all Bahía Colorada.<br><br>But she was in love with Valentín.<br><br>Who was it?<br><br>It was me!<br><br>- Don't be stupid!<br>- Oh yeah.<br><br>Out of jealousy, Tasio wanted to buy<br>your dad's workshop.<br><br>There was no amount of money<br>in the world to convince Valentín.<br><br>A STORMY DESTINY<br><br>A GAME WITHOUT RULES<br><br>FORBIDDEN MEMORIES<br><br>A MARTYR'S HILL<br><br>Goddamn it.<br>I was already having a bad day.<br><br>Oh, just relax, Don Tasio.

Right now.<br><br>Someone is crossing Sinaloa on a plane,<br>in a Boeing 375.<br><br>It's all clear. They look out the window...<br><br>"Look!"<br><br>"That kingdom... is owned by a guy..."<br><br>"THIS YEAR WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST<br>FOR BAHÍA'S ECONOMY"<br><br>"...a fine landlord whose name is<br>Anastasio Candelario."<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>Listen to me.<br><br>Cut the bullshit.<br><br>Doesn't it belong to your grandma?<br><br>- No, it was my old man's.<br>- And you don't care about the inheritance?<br><br>No, of course I care about...<br><br>When I finish the race,<br>all I want is to leave.<br><br>I don't want anything<br>to do with Bahía Colorada, okay?<br><br>Your little speeches<br>are starting to contradict one another.<br><br>I'm very sorry, young man.<br><br>You're competing against Marén.<br><br>And what if you win the rally<br><br>and I'm just sitting here,<br>closing deals with you?<br><br>How do you think she'll feel?<br><br>Maybe I can make a deal with you<br><br>if you don't race the rally.<br><br>No. Come on, sir. Of course not.<br><br>That's different.<br>I can't accept that offer.<br><br>I... I came to do justice<br>to the memory of my old man.<br><br>Not even your mother would buy that story!<br><br>I know that you're broke now.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I can smell it all over you.<br><br>Stop that, Don Tasio.<br><br>Workshop or rally. It's your choice.<br><br>Okay, let me run the race,<br>and I'll lose on purpose. That a deal?<br><br>Okay. Deal.<br><br>First, take your grandma<br>out of the workshop<br><br>and when she's out, I'll give you half.<br><br>And after you lose the race,<br>I'll give you the rest. Agree?<br><br>Sounds good to me.<br><br>Your least favorite guy is here,<br><br>but you'll hate me even more<br>when you know why I'm here.<br><br>- What's up, Grandma?<br>- Hi, son.<br><br>Come on, spit it out.<br><br>I...<br><br>Well, I, uh...<br><br>I'm gonna... I'm gonna need the workshop.<br><br>I might be wrong, but as far as I know,<br>it's mine by inheritance, hmm?<br><br>As far as you know?<br><br>It's yours, and that's it!<br><br>This workshop belongs to him,<br>and the boy sold it to me, okay?<br><br>So it's mine.<br><br>That's my dad's fork-spoon, asshole!<br><br>Why do you have it, bastard?<br>What the fuck?<br><br>What are you doing with his hat,<br>bastard? Who do you think you are?<br><br>Why do you wanna be<br>like my dad, bitch? What the fuck?<br><br>The Don Cruz candle? You have no right<br>to have these things, asshole!<br><br>Well, your mom left me everything, uh...<br><br>Since you didn't take anything<br>when you left...<br><br>Well, I'm here now, and I own this place,<br>okay, and everything in it. Got it?<br><br>We'll give you a week<br>for you to gather all your shit<br><br>and tie up your loose ends.<br><br>My boy, this doesn't belong to you.<br><br>Your grandfather was<br>the one who built it on his own.<br><br>It wasn't Valentín.<br><br>Come on, son.<br>Your brother and I live in this workshop.<br><br>If you want to take it from me,<br><br>you'll have to bring the will,<br>which obviously doesn't exist.<br><br>Let's not get lawyers involved.<br><br>Don't make me laugh, Constanza.<br><br>You don't have enough money<br>for a legal battle.<br><br>Spare us the drama.<br><br>Don Tasio,<br><br>if I love anything in this life,<br>it's a good drama.<br><br>Get the hell out of here, huh!<br><br>Because this is my church,<br><br>and you are not a believer.<br>Get the fuck out of here!<br><br>You have one week.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>I'm not scared, you know.

She really is.<br><br>And I was kinda sad because...<br><br>Dude, what's the matter with Preciado?<br><br>Why do people love him so much?<br><br>Why? Tell me!<br><br>I've lived here 15 years.<br>Fifteen! So what's good?<br><br>You're very expressive, huh?<br><br>It says that I listen, not that I answer.<br><br>I LISTEN TO ROMANTIC PROBLEMS<br>FOR $5<br><br>What the fuck is up with Preciado?<br><br>That dude's singing is totally awful!<br><br>Lazy asshole! He should<br>go and find another job.<br><br>I know! He should go back<br>to fixing cars, huh? He's good at that.<br><br>- He's very good at fixing cars.<br>- Yeah. He fixed my car, and it works fine.<br><br>Not even using that totune<br>that kids use now, he won't make it.<br><br>- "Totune"? Autotune, idiot!<br>- Same thing.<br><br>Not even that, dude.<br>He shouldn't sing, dude.<br><br>He's a kick in the balls.<br><br>No, I... I felt like<br>my ear was bleeding...<br><br>You're not scared of driving, are you?<br><br>No!<br><br>- I don't think so, at least.<br>- What's the worst that could happen?<br><br>- Us crashing!<br>- Yeah, but there's nothing here!<br><br>Oh, come on!<br><br>I'm so fuckin' worthless.<br><br>The only thing I have<br>in this world is you.<br><br>And I love you!<br>I don't want you to ever leave.<br><br>But you're, like, 200 years old, Grandma.<br><br>And my only other family is a fucking<br>idiotic motherfucker who, honestly,<br><br>will never accept me,<br>no matter what I say.<br><br>What will people remember me for?<br><br>For a band that was all shitty?<br><br>Or some fucking tuned-up Chevy? Nah!<br><br>I don't like to talk about this,<br>my boy, but...<br><br>...your grandpa moved on<br><br>while he was fixing his Rambler.<br><br>He was always here working.<br><br>He tinkered with his cars<br>more than he did me.<br><br>And, well, I finished fixing the car<br>because that's what he would have wanted.<br><br>But after that,<br>I felt this fucking resentment<br><br>towards that damn car.<br><br>My only wish was to sink it in the sea,<br>right to the bottom!<br><br>But when I was driving<br>on the highway, listen,<br><br>the more I sped up,<br>the more fired up I felt,<br><br>and the more pissed off I was.<br>And the more I sped up...<br><br>No, my dear boy. Hold on.<br><br>Let me tell you.<br><br>I always thought<br>that fishing was my thing.<br><br>I was the women's champion<br>four years in a row.<br><br>It was all I cared about.<br><br>But after having lived that experience<br>of driving so reckless,<br><br>I understood your grandfather<br>and his devotion to cars,<br><br>and I followed his passion.<br><br>This garage. You know what I'm saying.<br><br>If you don't want to race in the rally,<br>my boy, don't try it.<br><br>Because if you're nervous,<br>you'll crash and kill yourself.<br><br>Now, look how beautiful this is.<br><br>FIRST PLACE<br>FISHING TOURNAMENT<br><br>How did you manage<br>to carry those?<br><br>Just imagine<br>that I'm carrying you and your brother.<br><br>The fish burrito business<br>sounded good. Oh, look! He's here.<br><br>Let me introduce you, Mr. Valeriano.<br><br>The most badass badass in all of Mazatlán.<br><br>I only need you to sign these documents.<br><br>The magic<br><br>will be done by my attorney, Valeriano.<br><br>That shitty workshop will become<br>the most impressive gift shop<br><br>in all of Bahía Colorada.<br><br>Dad, you really need another one?<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>Open something else, like<br><br>a beauty parlor?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Just to put on fake nails<br><br>and do some male waxing?<br><br>Oh, don't try it.<br>I'm not insecure like you.<br><br>I'm not the one<br>that has a child they called Princess<br><br>because of your pretty, green eyes<br>and who knows...<br><br>Hey, that's enough!<br><br>Stop with that.<br><br>Didn't anyone teach you manners<br>or what, huh?<br><br>You left me lying there like an idiot.<br>I thought I loved you, Marén.<br><br>It might not have been good for you,<br>but it was good for me.<br><br>Fucking men!<br><br>You don't even love your mothers, hmm?<br>And as for driving, forget it!<br><br>Oh, so you're just gonna<br>leave me again? Okay, sure.<br><br>No! Piece of shit!<br>This always happens to me.<br><br>I killed your precious one, Mom.<br><br>No, no, don't say anything.<br>I'm gonna fix it, okay? I'll fix it.<br><br>Just leave it there!<br><br>Tell Bebé I'll have it ready in two days.<br><br>Oh, that's great. By the way,<br>in the morning I towed the precious one.<br><br>The precious one? And who exactly is that?<br><br>Don Tasio, I'm pulling out.<br><br>My family sucks, sure,<br>but they're my family, huh.<br><br>So you won't get in the way of that.<br><br>One way or another,<br>I'm gonna beat your whole family down.<br><br>Listen to me, you little brat.<br><br>I've still got your signature<br>on these documents here,<br><br>so there's no way out of this.<br><br>Yeah. We'll see.<br><br>I've been waiting all day to cut my cake.<br><br>Where's your boss and his lawyers?<br><br>Chillax, dude. I come in peace.<br><br>I came to...<br><br>I came to tell you that I canceled<br>the contract with Don Tasio.<br><br>I was wrong.<br><br>I know.<br><br>And I could use your help, Grandma.<br><br>- Hmm?<br>- Oh yeah?<br><br>Oh my God. You have no shame, man.<br><br>I wouldn't ask if there was<br>another good workshop anywhere close,<br><br>but there isn't.<br>You offered it to me, right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Huh? Told you.<br><br>Do you think that you can come here<br>and say and do whatever you want,<br><br>then play innocent<br>and everything will just be fine?<br><br>Well, no.<br><br>Not while I'm around.<br><br>Connie, remember the car?<br>Well, Cosme has it.<br><br>No, but I need them to get it<br>so I can fix it.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Okay. Here's my idea, huh?<br><br>Your grandfather's Rambler<br><br>that your father<br>and your uncle Cosme used in the rally,<br><br>that car still exists.<br><br>And it's the most powerful<br>piece of engineering in all of Mexico.<br><br>I promise you.<br><br>I'll tell you where it is,<br>and you can use it for the race, Romeo.<br><br>But you two have to pick it up.<br><br>It's a deal?<br><br>Sure, sure. Yeah, good idea. Why not?<br><br>Here's why.<br><br>He'll stab me in the back.<br><br>No, he should go alone. Why me?<br><br>In exchange,<br><br>we require you to sing in our band.<br><br>No, no!<br><br>That won't happen. No way.<br><br>I'd rather ask Don Tasio for help,<br><br>getting down on my knees in a pink thong<br>in front of all of fucking Bahía Colorada,<br><br>with Tino braiding my hair<br>down in my fucking asshole<br><br>before playing in your band.<br>How about that?<br><br>- Oh yeah?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well... well, I'd prefer to have<br>Donald Trump tattooed on my tits<br><br>and then getting my balls run over<br>by a tractor on national television,<br><br>and have Belinda making fun of me,<br>smashing a fucking apple to her forehead.<br><br>All that before<br>having you joining my band.<br><br>- You're crazy.<br>- How's that, bro?<br><br>I... I mean, just...<br><br>Who told you<br>that this fucking asshole could even sing?<br><br>Romeo.<br><br>Oh, Romeo.<br><br>Preciado.<br><br>My cousin.<br><br>Comrade.<br><br>You're looking for a car,<br>or else there's no rally.<br><br>And you... You're looking for a singer,<br><br>or there is no band.<br><br>How about we try to give<br>just as much as we receive?<br><br>And we all win. Sounds pretty good.<br><br>I'm telling you now<br>that I don't know the songs.<br><br>I don't know anything about<br>what we're going to sing...<br><br>Don't play dumb.<br>You know the songs Dad used to play.<br><br>I forgot. It's been a long time.<br>You know that.<br><br>Fuckin' piece of shit!<br><br>- See? Is this what you wanted?<br>- Just give him a chance.<br><br>Look, buddy. Play nice, okay?<br><br>I saw you singing<br>"El triste" on the sidewalk.<br><br>Who are you trying to fool?<br><br>Go ahead. Do it.<br><br>Stop that!<br><br>What the fuck is this, dude?<br><br>It sounds like fucking ass, dude.<br>Fucking music's awful. Fuck off!<br><br>This isn't what I sing or listen to.<br>I listen to Chopin,<br><br>Mozart, other fucking singers.<br><br>What do you know, anyway, huh?<br>My dad never loved you.<br><br>Oh-ho! That's a low blow,<br>even for you.<br><br>It's okay, man.<br><br>- That's why we do this, to feel.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>- "El irreparable" is a great song.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>Don't be afraid.<br><br>Come on. We all know that singing<br>made things move in there. It was obvious.<br><br>What do you know?<br>Fuck away from me.<br><br>Hey, Romeon!<br><br>See you tomorrow at 6:00, okay?<br>It's a date!<br><br>Get the fuck out of here, man!<br><br>10 DAYS UNTIL THE RALLY<br><br>I waited 45 minutes. I was about to leave.<br><br>What's all this? What's with the backpack?<br><br>Where are we going?<br><br>Well, I'm bringing a jacket.<br>It might be cold.<br><br>- Let's go.<br>- Cold?<br><br>Don't be stupid, dude.<br><br>- Thanks, Francisco.<br>- Of course. No problem.<br><br>A map, seriously?<br><br>Grandma made it.<br><br>Use the Internet.<br>Don't you have service out here?<br><br>I don't think<br>there's much 5G here.<br><br>It's that way.<br><br>The sun is nice, huh?<br><br>Yeah, right.<br><br>Holy fuck, man!<br><br>I think we're lost.<br><br>Come on, let's go!<br><br>Come on! Come on!<br><br>Are you tired already?<br><br>No way, man. Winning.<br><br>Romeo!<br><br>Goddamn it! Preciado, I can't move, dude.<br><br>My fucking underwear is all crumpled.<br>It feels like a thong!<br><br>I gave you a sandwich, buy you said no.<br><br>I think your sugar's low,<br>or it's just a heat stroke. Let me see.<br><br>- You think, dude?<br>- You'll feel better after this.<br><br>Oh shit. Back online?<br><br>You ready?<br>I'm ready, dude. Come on.<br><br>Do you have any idea<br>who lives here?<br><br>I've got no fucking clue.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Oh fuck.<br><br>Uncle Cosme?<br><br>- Uncle.<br>- Hmm?<br><br>We came because<br>we're gonna race La Bestia.<br><br>Oh? Is that right?<br><br>I am going to race La Bestia.<br><br>Wait, wait. I'm a little confused here.<br>Who will be in the race?<br><br>- Me.<br>- Me.<br><br>What the fuck, dude?<br>You don't care about the race.<br><br>- No.<br>- Grandma offered me the car, man.<br><br>Well, yeah, but I already signed up.<br><br>I'm gonna do the race<br>just like a... like a hobby...<br><br>- Yeah, right, dude.<br>- Wait.<br><br>What do you mean as a hobby?<br><br>Look, my passion is music.<br><br>Just like my old man, I also have a band.<br><br>Lágrimas Norteñas. We're doing very well.<br><br>Yeah, you sing<br>like nails on a chalkboard.<br><br>It's not true, Uncle.<br>His band is not good. It's not true.<br><br>When I'm on TV and dating Belinda,<br><br>you'll have to shut your mouth,<br>fucking asshole.<br><br>Yeah, sure, Belinda.<br><br>Are you planning to race on your own?<br><br>We want to do you guys justice<br><br>for the fraud they committed<br>in the past, you know?<br><br>Come here, you two fools.<br><br>These idiots!<br><br>And look what we have here!<br>Look!<br><br>And who's your wingman?<br><br>Uh, I don't have one. Not yet.<br><br>The only way<br>that this car's getting out of here<br><br>is if he does the race with you.<br><br>No way, man. No.<br><br>If this guy gets in the car,<br>it'll jinx it, Uncle. For real.<br><br>Yeah, likely.<br><br>Your car doors<br>are dragging on the pavement.<br><br>Was that you, asshole?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>It's about time you opened your eyes.<br><br>Because you look damn stupid.<br><br>THE CAPTIVATING ENCANTO BAND<br><br>Valentín was never even close<br>to winning the race.<br><br>Ah, he tried hard and all.<br><br>He loved cars,<br><br>but honestly, he wasn't that good.<br><br>What?<br><br>- No way!<br>- Word.<br><br>And the fraud thing...<br><br>He made that up because, well,<br>he was a bad loser and he was prideful.<br><br>He was prideful as you two fuckers, huh?<br><br>Wanting to be like Valentín<br><br>won't bring you anything good.<br><br>See? I'm telling you, man, huh?<br><br>You don't have to be so hateful.<br>Look at you.<br><br>Forgot where you came from.<br><br>- Honestly.<br>- What's wrong with that?<br><br>This has been another episode<br>of your favorite show...<br><br>This can't be happening.<br><br>I am your host, Enrique Riquelme,<br><br>and all I have left to say is,<br>see you very soon, my people!<br><br>- I've never seen this video.<br>- Come on!<br><br>Is that...<br><br>Is that all?<br><br>That was the famous video<br>that made him the town's idol.<br><br>- Hey, dude.<br>- Hmm?<br><br>What if we tell our uncle that...<br><br>that we're gonna race the rally together,<br>just so he gives us the car, yeah?<br><br>He won't even notice<br>if I race it alone or not.<br><br>More lies?<br><br>Why do you want to win the rally, hmm?<br><br>There's no justice to be done here.<br><br>Because the only fraud here<br>was my old man.<br><br>Fraud or not, either way,<br><br>I think he'd like it for me to win<br>and dedicate it to him.<br><br>I'd rather cut off my own balls<br>than let Don Tasio and Marén win.<br><br>Preciado, come on. It's a matter of...<br>well, of pride, you know?<br><br>What the fucking fuck, man!<br><br>Hey, man.<br>What's with all those phone calls?<br><br>Nothing. Let's go.<br>Let's get the car, man.

Right, man?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well, it turns out<br><br>they weren't so destined for failure<br>in the end.<br><br>I mean, they did finish last, right?<br><br>But Preciado made his name<br>with his talent for tuning cars,<br><br>and the workshop became a business.<br><br>The band was offered<br>a record deal with a label.<br><br>By a good record label?<br>No way! It was shitty.<br><br>But with that, they paid off Romeo's debt.<br><br>And guess who ended up<br>joining the band Lágrimas Norteñas?<br><br>NORTHERN TEARS<br><br>Whoo!<br><br>Well, the next song is<br>an original.<br><br>It's called "Mujer, eres letal."<br><br>And we are Lágrimas Norteñas!</div>

	<h1>The Goat and Her Three Kids (2019) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Secluded from the world, a single mother of three has to defend that what's left of her family, at all cost, from a cold blooded killer. Based on one of the best known Romanian fairy tales (The Goat and Her Three Kids by Ion Creanga), this short film aims to unveil the true nature of the famed bed time story and to treat the audience to a different perspective, one that offers a glimpse at what the tragedy actually looks like beyond the happy songs and colorful characters.</p>

Remember?<br><br>[man]...in many ways.<br><br>It was destiny that they found each other.<br><br>I accepted that he was doing<br>a dangerous thing.<br><br>And I just kind of lived with that.<br><br>[seagulls calling]<br><br>Dad, come on!<br><br>Dad, come on!<br><br>Come on!<br><br>[man] I've always been curious.<br><br>I was always kind of fascinated<br>by wilderness,<br><br>and animals, and the sea.<br><br>[Peter] Stephen loved<br>being out in the wild.<br><br>The two of us would go swimming at 5:00<br>in the morning, as the sun was coming up.<br><br>I'd dive down. I would snorkel.<br><br>And he'd be holding my hand<br>and pointing, with his own snorkel,<br><br>and pointing out fish here and fish there.<br><br>"What's the biggest this?<br>What's the smallest that?"<br><br>"What's the... the least common whale?<br>What's the most common whale?"<br><br>Those endless "Why?"<br><br>"What? Where?"<br><br>"How often? How many?"<br><br>His interest in nature started<br>with us watching David Attenborough.<br><br>I'm in the middle of central New Guinea.<br><br>One of the few places left<br>on the surface of the Earth<br><br>that are truly unexplored.<br><br>[Stephen] I always had it in my head<br>that I wanted to be an explorer.<br><br>I always loved looking at places<br>like the Amazon<br><br>and Congo, and Indonesia,<br>and imagining what it's like to be there.<br><br>[boy] Keenan, looking good!<br><br>[Peter] When Stephen got to his teens,<br>I left the family home.<br><br>I almost don't want to think about it.<br><br>I feel very bad about it in ma... in ways.<br><br>He was very hurt.<br>He was very...

She just laughed.<br><br>[inspiring music playing]<br><br>I think I had done about 100 meters.<br><br>It took us many years<br>to reach those numbers.<br><br>The kid did 105 meters.<br><br>[applause]<br><br>That's when<br>you ask yourself some questions!<br><br>How will it all end?<br><br>We went to some competitions<br>for free diving in the sea.<br><br>They dived from the boat<br>using a rock as a counterweight.<br><br>[Alessia] And I said,<br>"Let's see how deep I can go."<br><br>By holding your breath,<br><br>you get to understand<br>a lot more about yourself.<br><br>I managed to descend to 52 meters.<br><br>- [man, in English] Well done!<br>- [cheering]<br><br>- [spectators] Brava!<br>- [applause and laughter]<br><br>[Enzo, in Italian]<br>To see such a young girl<br><br>reach such depths<br><br>attracted a lot of attention.<br><br>And then the federation<br>releases a statement<br><br>banning under-18s<br>from taking part in official competitions.<br><br>[Alessia] In my darkest moments, I cried.<br><br>There were arguments with my father,<br>with my coach.<br><br>At that moment, I said,<br>"What am I going to do now?"<br><br>- [cheering and applause]<br>- [man] Speech!<br><br>[in English] Being told you're being<br>best man is usually a very emotional,<br><br>bonding moment between friends.<br><br>[woman laughs]<br><br>However, I found out<br>some months after the decision was made<br><br>and through one of the lads.<br><br>[laughter]<br><br>[Stephen] I didn't know what<br>I was going to do with my life.<br><br>Also, I'm a bit worried...<br><br>I knew I didn't want to stay at home,<br>settle down.<br><br>I knew that wasn't gonna happen.<br><br>[woman] Look who's there!<br><br>I just hope you're brave,<br>pointing that thing at her.<br><br>[Stephen] But then my mother<br>just got sick.<br><br>I don't want to ruin another tape.<br><br>[laughing] No, no!<br><br>[Peter] Maura got cancer.<br><br>Do you remember last time?<br><br>[Peter] Both Stephen<br>and his younger brother Gary<br><br>were really close to their mother.<br><br>It was very upsetting for them.<br><br>[woman] You're taking their mammy.<br><br>They were a great lift to her.<br><br>[poignant music playing]<br><br>She died at such an early age.<br><br>Stephen had seen firsthand<br>how unjust fate can be.<br><br>It did inform his personal philosophies.<br><br>Live for today,<br><br>for you never know<br>what's coming down the line.<br><br>So he wanted to drink up<br>every last drop of the world.<br><br>[Stephen] The Amazon,<br>Congo, and Indonesia.<br><br>It had always been a dream of mine<br>to get to these places.<br><br>When I was young,<br>I collected National Geographic.<br><br>I remember, it was a picture of a gorilla<br>wading through this peat bog water,<br><br>and this photograph was taken<br>in Northern Congo.<br><br>[optimistic music playing]<br><br>I was going to travel to Congo,<br>and then find the gorillas.<br><br>It was kind of a daunting experience.<br><br>I'd never done anything like this.<br><br>[in French] What's your name?<br><br>Stephen. Steve.<br><br>- Stephen?<br>- Yes.<br><br>- Huh. Are you Christian?<br>- Yes.<br><br>- In Ireland, we are...<br>- Protestant?<br><br>No, Catholic.<br><br>[in English] Palm wine.<br><br>[man chuckles]<br><br>- [in French] Yes?<br>- [laughter]<br><br>- [Stephen, in English] Hi.<br>- Hello.<br><br>[Stephen] She's been<br>the village queen for how long?<br><br>- [man] Six years now.<br>- [Stephen] Six? Okay.<br><br>Looks like I'm staying here tonight<br>with this family.<br><br>[child singing]<br><br>[children laughing]<br><br>[Stephen] Apparently, everyone who<br>crosses the river gets river blindness.<br><br>So I'm told that I have it now.<br>I'll have to get some treatment.<br><br>At last.<br><br>Flippin' heck.<br><br>[bird calling]<br><br>Just over the Congolese border.<br><br>[child calling out]<br><br>[inspiring music playing]<br><br>[Stephen] Whoa!<br><br>- So here we are.<br>- [man] Okay.<br><br>[Stephen] It was one of my lifelong dreams<br>to be in such a place. I was, I'd made it.<br><br>And this really<br>lit something up inside me,<br><br>to do something really unusual<br>with my life.<br><br>To find what I was searching for,<br><br>I knew I needed to take<br>the less-traveled road.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>[calm, ethereal music playing]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>I wanted free diving to be my life.<br><br>So even though I saw four years<br>as a really long time,<br><br>I said, "Okay.<br>Come on, let's keep doing this."<br><br>Plenty of others would have said, "Okay."<br><br>"I'll do something else."<br><br>But not her. She carried on regardless.<br><br>She continued going to the pool,<br><br>to the sea.<br><br>Then you realize<br>there's something that drives her.<br><br>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<br><br>[Enzo] Once she turned 18...<br><br>she suddenly arrived, like a rocket.<br><br>[Homar, in Italian]<br>She immediately showed her potential.<br><br>150 meters in the pool.<br><br>At first, it was, "Wow."<br><br>But Ilaria was better.<br><br>[in Italian]<br>I certainly wasn't expecting this result.<br><br>[Ilaria, in English]<br>I was the strongest in Italy.<br><br>Alessia was the only one<br>that can get anywhere close to me.<br><br>[laughing] But Alessia, in that period,<br>was a really... crazy head.<br><br>[man, in Italian] Here's Alessia Zecchini.<br>Near the 200-meter wall.<br><br>Let's see if she turns.<br><br>No, she's coming out.<br><br>[Ilaria, in English]<br>She was really young, with a teenage mind.<br><br>She was sad.<br><br>She was upset.<br><br>[in Italian] It was really tough.<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>I knew if I pushed more,<br>I wouldn't have come out well.<br><br>[announcer] Ilaria Bonin!<br><br>[man] Go on, Ilaria!<br><br>[cheering and applause]<br><br>[Ilaria, in English]<br>If you want to be the best<br><br>and you always take silver medal...<br><br>[winces]<br><br>Ah, it's something that drives you mad.<br><br>[Enzo, in Italian] When someone out there<br>is stronger than you,<br><br>it becomes another motivation.<br><br>[quiet conversation in Italian]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian] I had to improve<br>so much to set an Italian record.<br><br>For me, it took watching Natalia's videos<br>to realize how I could get there.<br><br>[in Russian] My advice<br>is that mental relaxation<br><br>is the foundation of free diving.<br><br>If we want to be successful underwater,<br><br>we should be relaxed,<br>not running towards some goal.<br><br>[uplifting music playing]<br><br>[in English] She start to approach<br>the competition in a different way.<br><br>She was so relaxed.<br><br>[man, in Italian] That's good. Stop.<br><br>Brava! [counting in Italian]<br><br>[woman cheers]<br><br>[man, in Italian] An amazing<br>224-meter performance.<br><br>[in English] She was so satisfied<br>when she reached the gold medal.<br><br>[man, in Italian] Congratulations<br>for this new Italian title.<br><br>Yes, it's amazing. At last!<br><br>[Ilaria, in English]<br>That moment was the beginning<br><br>of our deep friendship.<br><br>This result was always written.<br><br>She had some supernatural power<br>with free diving.<br><br>[applause and cheering]<br><br>But the pool was too small for Alessia.<br><br>[seabirds calling]<br><br>The sea was really her home.<br><br>[Peter] Stephen thought that he'd meet<br>his ultimate destiny somewhere in Africa.<br><br>With the lads in Ethiopia.<br><br>[Peter] Ethiopia, Sudan,<br><br>Sierra Leone...<br><br>[horns honking]<br><br>- Nigeria.<br>- [cheering]<br><br>He traveled with a lot of care<br>and seriousness.<br><br>However, very bad things nearly happened<br>on a number of occasions.<br><br>In Guinea, there was a popular uprising<br>against the president.<br><br>[gunshots]<br><br>There's been gunfire all morning.<br><br>Every so often, you hear, "bam, bam, bam."<br><br>[gunshots continue]<br><br>[Peter] He was torn and conflicted.<br><br>He'd say, "I wonder, should I be doing<br>what all my friends are doing?"<br><br>"Getting married.<br>Some of them have children."<br><br>"What am I not doing<br>that I should be doing?"<br><br>"Am I right living my life the way I am?"<br><br>[animal cooing]<br><br>He asked me once<br><br>if I was disappointed in him.<br><br>Wandering around the world like this,<br><br>searching for something<br>that he couldn't put his finger on.<br><br>[insects chirping]<br><br>[Stephen] Been thinking about family,<br>my friends.<br><br>It is, without doubt, the lowest,<br><br>awfullest time of my life right now.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>until tomorrow.<br><br>[Peter] He was going to come home<br>and live the conventional life.<br><br>But before that,<br>he was going to make one last stop.<br><br>[ethereal music playing]<br><br>Stephen always loved the sea.<br><br>He loved scuba diving out in the ocean.<br><br>He heard that there was a town in Egypt<br>which is kind of a mecca for divers.<br><br>[Stephen] I recall going along the coast<br>and just listening to the sea.<br><br>I got a real feeling of hope<br>about this place.<br><br>[man] When Steve drive from Cairo by bus,<br><br>all the way to Dahab,<br><br>he just throw the bag in the room.<br><br>He just, "Where's the bar?<br>Let's go have a drink."<br><br>Next day, he go diving.<br><br>He become a friend.<br><br>We see each other every day.<br><br>He loved the Bedouin culture.<br>He learned Arabic.<br><br>We become like family.<br><br>[Peter] He stayed down there,<br>making a living instructing scuba diving.<br><br>[children shouting]<br><br>So I arrived here<br>to do my Divemaster course,<br><br>and that was Steve.<br><br>He was my instructor.<br><br>Before long, we were hanging out daily.<br><br>And going out dancing.<br><br>[Mahmoud] Dahab, for Steve, a second home.<br><br>[Peter] He had a little house of his own.<br>He just loved it.<br><br>'Cause he told me at one stage,<br><br>"I've discovered this new thing<br>called free diving,<br><br>and it's the business."<br><br>[Kristof] Steve asked me to join him<br>on a free dive session.<br><br>[ethereal music playing]<br><br>The first time I dived down,<br>holding my breath,<br><br>all the problems and the shit<br>from daily life just vanished.<br><br>It doesn't exist down there.<br>It's beautiful.<br><br>Steve just fell in love with free diving.<br><br>And especially the Blue Hole.<br><br>You literally walk<br>from the beach into an abyss.<br><br>Like, there is this gaping hole<br>in the coral reef,<br><br>which really, like,<br>wants you to go down there.<br><br>And then there's this arch,<br>like a chapel underwater.<br><br>Unfortunately, it also has a...<br>a bad reputation.<br><br>It took lives.<br><br>[man] This is the most dangerous dive site<br>on Earth.<br><br>It's thought to have claimed<br>over 100 lives.<br><br>[man] In terms of fatalities,<br><br>the Blue Hole is even more perilous<br>than Mount Everest.<br><br>As well as myself,<br><br>there's only a handful of people<br>who have free dived through it.<br><br>Natalia Molchanova was<br>the only woman to do it.<br><br>[in Russian] Diving the Arch has left<br>a lasting impression on me.<br><br>[man, in English] This is the dive<br>that unlocked something within herself.<br><br>A fearlessness<br>that she didn't know was there.<br><br>It made her<br>the best free diver in the world.<br><br>With the Arch,<br>you've got to know if you're ready for it.<br><br>It's a really deceiving place to dive.<br><br>You have to find the exit.<br><br>If you aren't able<br>to see it clearly for any reason,<br><br>you're basically on your own.<br><br>If something does go wrong,<br>there's no way to come up.<br><br>There's 30 meters of rock over your head.<br><br>[woman] Outside the Blue Hole,<br><br>there are the memory stones<br>remembering the people who died there.<br><br>My boyfriend died in... in the Blue Hole,<br><br>just when I moved to Egypt.<br><br>It is dangerous because it is deep.<br><br>It is always the ocean.<br><br>And we are nothing.<br><br>[man] So you've said that your objective<br><br>is to become the second woman<br>in the world, after Natalia Molchanova,<br><br>to conquer all the absolute world records.<br><br>So how long do you think<br>this is gonna take you?<br><br>[cheering and applause]<br><br>[Alessia, in English] I don't know.<br>[laughs] Of course, it's a dream.<br><br>Really, a dream for every athlete,<br>I think.<br><br>But it's really difficult.<br><br>[man, in English]<br>Natalia Molchanova, champion of the deep,<br><br>holding over 40 free diving records,<br><br>some of them incredible,<br>death-defying feats.<br><br>[in English]<br>Today, my dive was 101 meters.<br><br>[man] That's 101 meters down and up.<br><br>More than two Statues of Liberty,<br><br>stacked ground to torch.<br><br>[woman] Natalia was the first<br>female free diver to reach 101 meters<br><br>in competition.<br><br>And she held that number<br>for a very long time.<br><br>So 101 was the magical number<br>Alessia was trying to beat.<br><br>[in Italian] I want to improve<br>by a few meters.<br><br>In fact, I hope to go<br>well beyond 90 meters,<br><br>to then touch the three-digit number<br>in a couple of years.<br><br>[in English] Everybody must have a dream<br>and put all their effort in.<br><br>And really, everything is possible.<br><br>[host] Can you describe the feeling<br>of diving at those... those kind of depths?<br><br>Talk about the feeling on the body<br>of the pressure.<br><br>[Alessia, in English]<br>The deeper I'm diving,<br><br>the pressure compresses<br>the air in my lungs,<br><br>until my lungs are the size of my fist.<br><br>[heartbeat]<br><br>After 30 meters,<br>the pressure pushes me down.<br><br>[heartbeat slowing]<br><br>It's called the free fall.<br><br>And this is, for me, the best part.<br><br>It feels like you are flying.<br><br>The silence, it's unique.<br><br>It's like being<br>in the last quiet place on the Earth.<br><br>[heartbeat deepening and slowing]<br><br>[Adam] There's a surrender element to it.<br><br>It's like a high.<br><br>But getting sucked to the bottom<br>of the sea can be scary,<br><br>even for free divers.<br><br>You have to break this deep meditation.<br><br>'Cause coming back to the surface,<br>that's when the work really starts.<br><br>You've gotta swim the length<br>of a 70-storey skyscraper.<br><br>Swimming against all that pressure,<br>it's like swimming against the current.<br><br>By then,<br>your oxygen supply's already dwindled.<br><br>You're kicking hard<br>so your heart rate's increasing,<br><br>burning that oxygen quicker.<br><br>[urgent music playing]<br><br>You're getting to the point<br><br>where you don't have enough oxygen<br>to keep the systems going.<br><br>That's when you can have a blackout.<br><br>[William] The brain<br>basically just turns itself off.<br><br>It doesn't mean that your brain is dying.<br><br>But it's kind of like a safety mechanism.<br><br>The brain preserves itself<br>by shutting off all its functions.<br><br>And from that moment,<br>you still have one or two minutes<br><br>before brain damage would start to occur.<br><br>[man] Right, one more.<br><br>[blowing]<br><br>[pensive music playing]<br><br>[William] If you don't have<br>the right kind of medical attention,<br><br>it can go downhill pretty quick.<br><br>It's definitely not something<br>to be taken lightly.<br><br>[Kristof] For years, Steve<br>and I were always trying to dive deeper.<br><br>It became like a game between us.<br>I was going for the Belgian record.<br><br>He was chasing the Irish one,<br>which was 61 meters.<br><br>When you start competing,<br>you wanna push yourself.<br><br>[pensive music continues]<br><br>[Stephen chokes]<br><br>[Kristof] He had a few blackouts<br>in the beginning.<br><br>He likes to bang his head on the wall.<br>You know, really, like, "Let's do this!"<br><br>And, like, "I can't,<br>but I'm gonna do it anyway."<br><br>- [Kristof] How deep?<br>- Sixty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Shite.<br><br>[panting]<br><br>[Kristof] But Steve never gives up.<br><br>[inspirational music playing]<br><br>- Yeah!<br>- [cheering]<br><br>And it made him very proud<br>to be the best Irish.<br><br>[Peter] The other attraction<br>of free diving<br><br>was that it was a boundary.<br><br>A boundary to be pushed.<br><br>Free diving is an extreme sport.<br><br>And extreme sports<br>have extreme consequences.<br><br>[gasping]<br><br>Stephen?<br><br>[Kristof] Steve had a really,<br>really strong blackout.<br><br>The safety team just didn't know<br>what to do with him.<br><br>- [man] Stephen...<br>- [Stephen wails]<br><br>[Kristof] He almost died there.<br><br>[man] Release... release him.<br><br>We should go back.<br><br>[Kristof] He didn't want<br>anyone else going through that.<br><br>So he started to be interested<br>in being a safety diver.<br><br>Steve had the best background for the job<br><br>because the only other person<br>that can do a safety for a free diver<br><br>is a free diver.<br><br>As a scuba diver,<br>you can't be a safety for a free diver<br><br>because they go up slowly to decompress.<br><br>So if something happens,<br>you have to react fast.<br><br>[Stephen] 99% of all free diving incidents<br>happen within the last ten meters.<br><br>If there is an issue, we close the airways<br>so they can't swallow water,<br><br>and we take them to the surface.<br><br>[woman] Please get out of the way<br>for the safety.<br><br>[Kristof] He worked very hard<br>to make a name for himself.<br><br>No. I'm doing it myself. So, uh...<br><br>[Kristof] After a while,<br>Steve got the chance<br><br>to be on the safety team in Kalamata,<br><br>which was his first<br>international big competition.<br><br>[man] That's all good. Put it down.<br><br>[Adam] Natalia's son, Alexey Molchanov,<br><br>was the men's world record holder<br>at the time.<br><br>He was going for the deepest dive ever.<br><br>And his mom is watching.<br><br>[tense music playing]<br><br>Safety, keep your distances.<br><br>Eighty.<br><br>[Kristof] Steve was the first safety.<br><br>That means he has to dive the deepest.<br><br>[tense music continues]<br><br>[Adam] Stephen kicked down to 30 meters.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>[Kristof] You have to know,<br>as a safety diver,<br><br>you take in a mouthful of air,<br>you go down,<br><br>and if everything goes right,<br>you just swim up together.<br><br>You're never there<br>for longer than a minute.<br><br>But Steve was already waiting<br>at 30 meters for quite some time,<br><br>- so he's running out of air.<br>- [beeping]<br><br>Come on, Alexey.<br><br>3'30, it's a very long dive time.<br><br>Andrea, you go down as well.<br><br>[tense music continues]<br><br>- Trouble.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>[woman] Trouble?<br><br>[Kristof] Steve started<br>to have contractions.<br><br>He's seconds away from the blackout.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>But then he saw Alexey get into trouble<br>around 40 meters.<br><br>Split-second decisions.<br><br>Save Alexey or save himself.<br><br>[man speaking Russian]<br><br>[Alexey groaning]<br><br>[Stephen, in English]<br>Breathe, Alexey.

Like,<br>you're super famous in the community."<br><br>"You have to start promoting yourself."<br><br>Because Stephen knew all the free divers,<br><br>they were able to invite<br>all these big names,<br><br>like Alexey Molchanov, to give workshops.<br><br>And this attracted a lot of free divers.<br><br>The school became super famous.<br><br>[man] For you, what is success in life?<br><br>I suppose success is fulfilling<br>your aspirations, goals, dreams.<br><br>I'm currently living in Egypt,<br>where I run a free diving center.<br><br>I guess I'm happy in that respect.<br>I like what I do.<br><br>Other parts of my life<br>are not so successful, I guess.<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm a 38-year-old man,<br>and I don't have any kids.<br><br>I suppose that's, people say,<br>something that I haven't quite fulfilled.<br><br>[wistful music playing]<br><br>He had some relationships in Dahab,<br>but, uh,<br><br>nothing that lasted.<br><br>He would've liked to, like, fall in love<br><br>and have a long-term relationship<br>and kids.<br><br>Part of him was missing that side.<br><br>He needed to meet a super special person.<br><br>[man] Thank you so much<br>for taking the time to talk to me,<br><br>and for all the listeners of the show too.<br><br>[Alessia, in English]<br>Thank you.

There's many little facets<br>that can affect a dive.<br><br>And if somebody, when diving,<br>wants to feel secure,<br><br>they're very happy if they're diving<br>with someone they're familiar with,<br><br>and they know that<br>the safety diver is familiar with them.<br><br>How they dive.

Ciao!<br><br>[in English] And in first place,<br><br>with an incredible dive today<br>of 104 meters,<br><br>and a new world record,<br><br>Alessia Zecchini!<br><br>[cheering and applause]<br><br>[Leigh] Alessia gave Stephen<br>the biggest hug.<br><br>He really did believe in her.<br><br>There was just something about her<br>that he knew that she could do it.<br><br>He didn't doubt her for a second.<br><br>[in Italian] Give a round of applause<br>for Alessia Zecchini!<br><br>- Hi, Alessia.<br>- Hi.<br><br>- Welcome.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Beautiful, talented, young.<br>You've got it all.<br><br>So, nine world championship gold medals,<br>four silver,<br><br>one bronze.<br><br>The ultimate record, the most famous one,<br>the one you are proudest of,<br><br>so much so, you put it around your neck,<br><br>the 104-meter world record.<br><br>[applause]<br><br>Any other ambitions, aims, goals?<br><br>[Francesca, in English] Even after<br>becoming the deepest woman in the world,<br><br>Natalia was still her inspiration.<br><br>Alessia was motivated<br>by all the achievements<br><br>that Natalia had garnered in her lifetime.<br><br>And there was one thing left.<br><br>The Arch in Dahab.<br><br>People thought she couldn't do it.<br><br>And she wanted to prove,<br>both to herself and to everyone else,<br><br>that she could.<br><br>As fate would have it,<br><br>Stephen wanted her to train<br>with him in Dahab.<br><br>And there was definitely<br>an amazing connection<br><br>between Alessia and Stephen.<br><br>[uplifting music playing]<br><br>[in Italian] Stephen told us he was going<br>to pick Alessia up at the airport.<br><br>"Look what I made."<br><br>He pulled out<br><br>an airport sign<br>with "Alessia" written on it.<br><br>He was really excited, really happy.<br><br>He wanted everything to be perfect<br>for Alessia's arrival.<br><br>I haven't told you where we are yet.<br><br>I'm in Dahab for training.<br><br>It's beautiful here.<br><br>Okay, everything is ready.<br><br>We're here at the diving center,<br>packing everything.<br><br>Then we'll head to the sea.<br>I'll show you the Blue Hole.<br><br>[Alessia] He seemed<br>more excited than I was.<br><br>And I found that quite endearing.<br><br>[man, in English] That's prickish.<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>But we were both a bit awkward.<br><br>[Lily, in English] It was the first time<br>that we would see somebody cross the Arch,<br><br>and being involved in the dive<br>was super exciting.<br><br>We're gonna go training together.<br><br>I was like, "Oh my God.<br>I'm gonna train with Alessia. Dear Jesus!"<br><br>And she shows up<br>with a ham sandwich and a can of Coke.<br><br>I was like,<br>"Oh my God. Okay, I love her already."<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>Okay, Alessia. On your feet.<br><br>[man] I knew<br>she'd just set a world record.<br><br>She matched the world record<br>one day in training.<br><br>It was inspiring<br><br>to see someone do these depths<br>that I'd kinda only dreamed of doing.<br><br>And you could tell, like...<br><br>Like, even Steve, he'd be like,<br>"Ah, she makes it look too easy."<br><br>You know? But it was...<br>That was, like, that was her. [laughs]<br><br>[Lily] Alessia and Steve<br>were together all the time.<br><br>He was coaching her<br>and preparing her for the Arch,<br><br>sitting down every evening<br>after her training for weeks,<br><br>going through everything,<br>telling her what she should do next.<br><br>It's another evening in Dahab free divers.<br><br>[Lily] Then they were together<br>every evening.<br><br>[Stephen] Say hello.<br><br>Hello!<br><br>Say hello, guys.<br><br>[all] Hey.<br><br>[Lily] It was an amazing summer.<br><br>They had a very special connection.<br><br>It was just a really good match. [laughs]<br><br>Simon! Belated happy birthday, bud.<br>Hope you had a great one.<br><br>Sorry it's only me to say happy birthday.<br><br>Or actually, no,<br>there's somebody else. Wait.<br><br>Happy birthday!<br><br>[Stephen laughs]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>He adored being in the desert.<br><br>The happiness we shared was amazing.<br><br>[Lily, in English] We thought, "Okay,<br>this could be something pretty special."<br><br>We are gonna win the world championships.<br><br>We are gonna make world records.<br><br>And this amazing lady<br><br>is going to win the world championships.<br><br>True that.<br><br>[Homar, in Italian] We were all together<br>that evening. It was our last night.<br><br>And I remember<br>he turned to Alessia and said,<br><br>"You'll be the first woman<br>to do the Arch after Natalia Molchanova."<br><br>We told Stephen,<br><br>"Look after Alessia."<br><br>And obviously, as a safety, he told me...<br><br>"Leave it with me."<br><br>[bells clanking]<br><br>[in Italian] We're discussing the dive<br>before getting in the water.<br><br>This is my coach, Steve,<br>and these are some other athletes.<br><br>We'll get in the water soon.<br><br>I'm preparing all the gear.<br><br>We're ready to get in the water.<br><br>[Kristina, in English] Steve asked me<br>to take photos of this dive.<br><br>I took pictures<br>doing briefing for all safety divers.<br><br>Steve really went through each detail.<br><br>Everybody knew<br>exactly what they were supposed to do.<br><br>[Lily] The plan was Alessia would dive<br>52 meters, pulling herself on the rope,<br><br>and then, entering the Arch,<br>swim horizontally for 30 meters.<br><br>As she arrived<br>on the other side of the Arch,<br><br>the safety line should be there<br>in the middle.<br><br>Steve would be there<br>at the end of the line waiting for her.<br><br>Natalia crossed the Arch with a monofin.<br><br>[Nathan] What Alessia prepared for<br>was a dive without the monofin,<br><br>which is the hardest way you can do it.<br><br>[Lily] Maybe she wanted to do it that way<br><br>to be better<br>than the best free diver ever.<br><br>[rhythmic beeping]<br><br>Everything was timed.<br><br>They had made practice runs<br><br>to know how long exactly it takes<br>her to go down to 52 meters,<br><br>how long it takes for her<br>to swim horizontally for 30 meters.<br><br>And we had a countdown,<br><br>so we would make sure that Steve<br>would be already there before she arrived.<br><br>[beeping continues]<br><br>[Kristina] I go down<br>with the other two technical divers<br><br>with a camera to do the filming.<br><br>[Nathan] After she goes down,<br>my job was to hold the rope,<br><br>wait until we felt her hit the bottom,<br><br>go down a few meters, look.<br><br>If she wasn't coming back up,<br>come up and we're done.<br><br>After she swam through the Arch,<br><br>she was relying on finding the rope<br>on the other side to pull herself back up.<br><br>[man] Five, four, three, two, one, zero.<br><br>[Nathan] We watched Alessia go down.<br><br>I'm feeling the rope,<br>so I can tell when she reaches the bottom.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[faint, slow heartbeat]<br><br>[Nathan] After we felt her let go<br>of the rope, we'd give an okay sign<br><br>to tell the other safety divers<br>that she entered the Arch.<br><br>That should've triggered Steve to go down.<br><br>[Lily] Ten seconds.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Lily] I started to give<br>the countdown to Steve.<br><br>[Lily] Five, four, three.<br><br>He asked me for ten more seconds.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>I just didn't really understand why,<br>because, um...<br><br>so far, everything had been going<br>according to plan.<br><br>So maybe the heart was going<br>a bit too fast for his liking,<br><br>so he wanted to take a few more seconds<br>to be really ready.<br><br>I really don't know,<br>because you can't discuss with him,<br><br>because he's preparing for his dive,<br>so he's not gonna talk.<br><br>It took him a little bit extra<br>to give me the signal.<br><br>[steady heartbeat]<br><br>[somber music playing]<br><br>[heartbeat slowing]<br><br>[Kristina] Alessia is coming out<br>of the Arch, but Steve is not there.<br><br>She doesn't see the rope.<br><br>She is swimming the wrong direction.<br><br>She didn't realize<br>that she was already out.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Lily] I have, uh, one hand on the rope.<br><br>I'm waiting for the feel of the pull<br>to say that they're starting to come up.<br><br>The pull is not coming.<br><br>I start to worry.<br><br>[beeping]<br><br>Maybe she was swimming<br>a little bit slower.<br><br>Let's wait a little bit longer.<br><br>[Nathan] They should've been coming up<br><br>by the time<br>we swam across to the other side.<br><br>I knew at that point something was wrong.<br><br>[Lily] Now it's too long.<br><br>Something is not right.<br><br>[rapid heartbeat]<br><br>[Kristina] Alessia needs<br>to go up immediately.<br><br>She didn't know<br>that she's in completely the wrong place.<br><br>In one moment,<br>Steve left the rope super quickly.<br><br>[very fast heartbeat]<br><br>As a scuba diver, I cannot do shit.<br><br>I was very far.<br><br>I was just screaming.<br><br>[Lily] I could see<br>all the way to the end of the line.<br><br>There was no one.<br><br>[fast heartbeat continues]<br><br>[Nathan] We just can't see them.<br><br>Think fast.<br>Maybe the water current took them.<br><br>We would need to search<br>a much bigger area.<br><br>Thirty meters away, there was loads<br>and loads of tourists snorkeling.<br><br>[man laughing]<br><br>[inhales]<br><br>We're looking for someone amongst a mess<br>of people that can't properly swim.<br><br>[Lily] Everywhere I look,<br>they're not there.<br><br>I decided to come up and see<br>if I could see them on the surface.<br><br>[speaks French]<br><br>[Lily] There was no explanation.<br><br>[Kristina] I was swimming<br>as fast as I could.<br><br>I need to see if they are alive.<br><br>- [high-pitched ringing]<br>- [Alessia gasping]<br><br>[sounds fade]<br><br>[sighs]<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian] The first meters,<br>everything seemed normal.<br><br>Until I reached the Arch.<br><br>I remember while I was swimming,<br>I felt it was a bit strenuous.<br><br>There was a problem.<br><br>Steve wasn't there,<br>but neither was the rope.<br><br>I just tried to follow the reef,<br><br>trying to see where the rope was.<br><br>But I realized I couldn't find it.<br><br>I'd made a mistake.<br><br>I suddenly saw Steve in front of me.<br><br>I remember he took my hands.<br><br>And he swam, bringing me to the surface.<br><br>- [high-pitched ringing]<br>- [Alessia gasping]<br><br>I don't remember<br>the first seconds when I surfaced.<br><br>I only remember, after a while,<br><br>looking around<br>and not understanding a thing.<br><br>[Kristina, in English]<br>Steve's face was in the water.<br><br>And I started screaming on her,<br>like, "Turn him face up!"<br><br>But I didn't realize<br>that she had blacked out.<br><br>And when I started screaming,<br>because I really screamed a lot,<br><br>she basically woke up,<br>and she started acting immediately.<br><br>Um...<br><br>[in Italian] Maybe I could have done more.<br><br>If I had been more conscious,<br>I don't know.<br><br>[Nathan, in English] If you are<br>on your own, and you start blacking out,<br><br>you have to be on your back.<br><br>If you're not on your back, you're done.<br><br>Steve probably took<br>his last seconds of consciousness<br><br>to make sure she was in a position<br>that she'd survive in<br><br>at the expense of ending up face down.<br><br>[poignant music playing]<br><br>[in Italian] The worst thing is<br>we couldn't do anything.<br><br>We couldn't save him.<br><br>He rescued me, but I couldn't rescue him.<br><br>[mournful music playing]<br><br>He was a hero,<br>and he showed it till the end.<br><br>[Kristina, in English]<br>You can see in the last photo,<br><br>he lost his life to save hers.<br><br>I was diving the lighthouse.<br><br>Like, actually, over there.<br><br>I finish my dive, I...<br><br>I look at my phone,<br><br>even, like, with my suit on, like, I...<br><br>My phone, I look at my phone,<br>like, "What?"<br><br>Like, there are 50 missed calls.<br><br>And I received a phone call.<br><br>Something happened to Steve.<br><br>And...<br><br>It... They couldn't bring him back.<br><br>My first reaction was,<br>"Shit. I wasn't there."<br><br>"I could've saved him<br>if I would have been there."<br><br>[sighs]<br><br>[sobbing]<br><br>[Francesca] He was choosing her<br>over himself.<br><br>I'm very clear that he knew<br>that someone was gonna die that day,<br><br>and he wasn't gonna let it be her.<br>[sniffles]<br><br>[in Italian] I would give my life.<br><br>Mine instead of his.<br><br>[in English] He wouldn't...<br>he wouldn't have forgiven himself<br><br>if he wouldn't have saved her, you know?<br><br>[Francesca] Everybody,<br>we'll just dive until we feel<br><br>we want to release our flowers<br><br>and give thanks<br>for such a wonderful human in our lives,<br><br>sending all the good energy<br><br>that Stephen gave to all of us.<br><br>[poignant music playing]<br><br>[Peter] Everybody who loved Stephen<br>did a big underwater vigil.<br><br>They all held their breath for 39 seconds<br>to represent each year of his life.<br><br>There was never ever a death<br><br>which moved the place<br>the way that this... this one did.<br><br>It was hundreds of people.<br>I mean, everybody.<br><br>How? How can one person touch so many?<br><br>He must've been<br>a pretty special person, right?<br><br>[laughs]<br><br>Part of grief is kind of selfish.<br><br>And the selfish part of grief...<br>makes me miss him. I miss him.<br><br>I miss him not coming home.<br>I miss him in my life.<br><br>But I am much consoled by how he lived.<br><br>He was pretty courageous.<br><br>The Masai plains.<br><br>We're completely alone.<br><br>Jebel Toubkal.<br><br>Nice mountain in North Africa.<br><br>[hopeful music playing]<br><br>[Peter] Stephen was searching<br>for something all of his life.<br><br>I did it! [laughs]<br><br>[Peter] He had found something he loved<br><br>and somebody who shared his dream.<br><br>Alessia and the sea.<br>They were all he needed.<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>He will always be with me.<br><br>I remember his eyes...<br><br>and try to remember<br>all the things he'd tell me.<br><br>To live, to be happy.<br><br>To believe in myself.<br><br>[in English] Enjoy yourself to the max!<br><br>Okay? Kiss.<br><br>[Alessia, in Italian]<br>I try and remember his hugs.<br><br>He's the person who made me realize<br>what it really means to hug someone.<br><br>From the hug, you'd understand<br>how deeply he cared about you<br><br>and all the feelings<br>you could share together.<br><br>He gave his life<br><br>for Alessia.<br><br>A pain like this stays with you.<br><br>You go on.<br><br>But that wound is there,<br>and it won't heal.<br><br>[Alessia] He will always be in my heart.<br><br>He's going to be with me forever,<br><br>because I want him to stay with me<br>for the rest of my life.<br><br>[music fades]<br><br>[water rippling gently]<br><br>[emotional music playing]</div>

Um...<br><br>Why don't I do this?<br>Why don't I go downstairs,<br><br>turn off that big red switch<br>at the top of the box?<br><br>That'll cut off power<br>to the entire house.<br><br>And then you can go fix<br>the outlet, not die.<br><br>When you're done not dying,<br>I'll come back downstairs,<br><br>I'll turn the power back on.<br><br>And then I, and I alone,<br><br>will walk throughout the entire house,<br><br>fix all the clocks and the router,<br><br>'cause I know that's what you're<br>fucking worried about."<br><br>And I promise you if my dad<br>had died that day,<br><br>I'd have written that shit<br>on his tombstone.<br><br>"Here lies Scott Porter,<br><br>'cause he didn't wanna fuck<br>with the router."<br><br>And there'd be a USB port<br>in the tombstone<br><br>where you could charge your<br>phone off his charred remains.<br><br>I've put my dad through a lot.<br><br>Not as a child, I was a good kid.<br><br>But as an adult,<br>I put him through some paces.<br><br>I haven't lived in Kansas City<br>for over 13 years.<br><br>So when I come home,<br>it's a bit of an event.<br><br>Sometimes, my parents<br>have parties for us.<br><br>Sometimes, we just have parties<br>at my parents'<br><br>and don't fucking tell 'em.<br>Um...<br><br>But two Aprils ago,<br>I was home for a wedding.<br><br>Through a bunch of weird<br>experiences, I've become friends<br><br>with Justin Verlander, who's a<br>pitcher for the Houston Astros.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>At the time, he was pitching<br>for the Detroit Tigers.<br><br>And they had a night off in Kansas City.<br><br>So Justin and I and a few<br>of his teammates<br><br>went out and had a few drinks.<br><br>While we were out,<br>Justin saw a young lady,<br><br>he goes, "I'm pretty sure<br>I know that girl.<br><br>I think she's an actress.<br><br>I think my fiancée and I<br>hung out with her last weekend.<br><br>I should probably go say hello."<br><br>I said, "Justin, we're in Kansas City.<br><br>There's no way that chick's an actress.<br><br>She probably works<br>at Cheesecake Factory."<br><br>He said, "No,<br>I think that's her."<br><br>Calls the waiter over, he goes,<br>"Who's that girl over there?"<br><br>Waiter says, "I don't know<br>who the girl is,<br><br>but everyone at that table's<br>with Mumford & Sons.<br><br>They're here playing<br>the Arena tomorrow night.<br><br>And they're here having dinner."<br><br>And Justin says, "Well,<br>send them a bottle on us."<br><br>Meaning him. Because...<br>I'm not paying for that shit.<br><br>Uh, first off,<br>not a big Mumford & Sons fan.<br><br>Second off, if I'm hanging out with you<br><br>and I know you've signed a<br>contract for over $100 million,<br><br>I'm not paying for shit.<br><br>Yeah, fuck you, dude.<br>You pay for shit,<br><br>it's not even on your register.<br><br>I pay for shit, I don't even get<br>to buy shoes next month.<br><br>And I'm gonna be fucking pissed.<br><br>So he sends them a bottle.<br>They come over to say thank you.<br><br>Turns out it's not Mumford & Sons.<br><br>It's just & Sons.<br><br>Mumford isn't there.<br>I don't know where he was.<br><br>I'm assuming he's back<br>at the hotel writing a song<br><br>that at some point goes...<br>♪ Oooh<br><br>So & Sons come over, start<br>talking to the Detroit Tigers.<br><br>I'm not really involved.<br>I kind of tune it all out.<br><br>But when I come back into focus,<br>& Sons are talking shit<br><br>to the Detroit Tigers about beer pong.<br><br>& Sons are like, "We'll fucking<br>whoop your ass<br><br>in some beer pong."<br><br>And the Detroit Tigers are like,<br>"We get paid very handsomely<br><br>to put balls places.<br><br>Fucking bring it."<br><br>And I said, "Hey, fellas.<br><br>My parents live about<br>eight minutes from here.<br><br>We could settle this."<br><br>The reason I said that<br>was 'cause I was fully aware<br><br>that both & Sons and the Detroit Tigers<br><br>have an entire floor at whatever<br>hotel they're staying at<br><br>to do whatever the fuck they wanna do.<br><br>So there was no reason<br>to come to my parents' house.<br><br>It was complete fake hospitality,<br><br>until they all turned around<br>and looked at me and said,<br><br>"Fuck yeah!<br>Let's go to your parents' house<br><br>and play beer pong!"<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>And that's when I went,<br>"Oh, shit!"<br><br>'Cause it is now two o'clock<br>on a Sunday night,<br><br>technically Monday morning.<br><br>My parents are not gypsies.<br>All right?<br><br>They have real jobs<br>with real responsibilities.<br><br>And that shit's about to start<br>in about six hours.<br><br>So I... what am I gonna do?<br><br>Like, I can't look at these guys<br>and be like, "You guys!<br><br>My parents." Right?<br><br>So I just said, "Fuck it,<br>let's roll the dice,<br><br>see what happens."<br><br>So we start to leave the bar.<br><br>As we do, my sister texted me<br>'cause she was also in town.<br><br>She said, "Hey, I'm out and about.<br><br>If you get home before I do,<br>will you walk my dog?"<br><br>And I texted back, "Unless<br>you're out and about<br><br>with the goddamn Dave Matthews Band,<br><br>you better get your fucking ass home,<br><br>'cause shit's about to go down<br>at Ma and Pa's house."<br><br>So at 2:30 on a Sunday night,<br><br>me, my sister, and about 12 dudes<br><br>roll into my parents' basement<br>and start throwing beer pong.<br><br>And let me tell you, shit got weird.<br><br>Like, weirder than<br>I've already described.<br><br>Like, my sister, who's 30,<br>ended up in her prom dress.<br><br>I don't know. I don't know<br>how that happened.<br><br>God bless her for being able<br>to fit in it.<br><br>But also, the fuck?<br><br>All right? So...<br><br>About 3:30, I decide to go out<br>and smoke some weed.<br><br>Ampersand Sons come with me.<br><br>But as it was the middle<br>of the baseball season,<br><br>the Detroit Tigers could not partake,<br><br>so they had to pretend like it<br>was the playoffs and watch.<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>So we come back in from smoking weed,<br><br>and my dad's downstairs and he's pissed.<br><br>Like, "What's up, Dad?"<br><br>And he's like, "What the fuck's<br>going on down here?"<br><br>I go, "Well, this is & Sons,<br><br>of Mumford & Sons.<br><br>And this is half<br>the Detroit Tigers' bullpen.<br><br>And we're playing beer pong.<br><br>And it was in that moment that I realized<br><br>my father was no longer sure<br>if he was actually awake.<br><br>You gotta look at it<br>from Dad's point of view.<br><br>He walks downstairs<br>in the middle of the night,<br><br>sees a bunch of weird dudes<br>that he kind of recognizes,<br><br>and my sister's in her prom dress.<br><br>Yeah. Shit's weird.<br><br>And Dad's confused as shit.<br>He's like, "I don't...<br><br>What... Is that<br>Justin Verlander?"<br><br>"Yes, sir, it is."<br><br>"Well, then I don't know what<br>the fuck's going on right now."<br><br>He walked upstairs, that was<br>the last I ever saw of him.<br><br>Not ever, just that night.<br>That would have been a weird...<br><br>That's a dark turn to that story.<br><br>That would have been funny<br>if he just was like,<br><br>"You know what? I'm just fucking<br>leaving the whole family<br><br>after this thing."<br><br>Whole next day,<br>I'm freaking the fuck out.<br><br>My parents have done a lot<br>for me over time.<br><br>I don't need to be pissing them<br>off over some bullshit.<br><br>So when my dad came home,<br>I was completely prepared<br><br>to take him out to dinner,<br>buy him some drinks,<br><br>make amends for the evening previous.<br><br>That was until my dad walked in the door<br><br>like he'd had the greatest<br>goddamn day of his life.<br><br>He walked in like... boom!<br>"What's up, everybody?<br><br>- How you doing? How you doing?<br>- All right!"<br><br>I go, "The fuck happened<br>to you today?"<br><br>And he just stopped, he goes,<br><br>"I fucking hated you<br>this morning."<br><br>He said, "I woke up on<br>about four hours sleep.<br><br>I cursed your name all the way to work.<br><br>But then I got to work,<br>and everyone started asking me<br><br>why I looked so tired and exhausted.<br><br>So I started bitching about<br>my son bringing home<br><br>the Detroit Tigers and Mumford & Sons<br><br>and playing beer pong all night.<br><br>And now I'm the coolest<br>motherfucker in the office."<br><br>Thank you very much, Denver.<br><br>God bless y'all.<br>See you next time.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

			<p class="plot">Francis is a nice, ordinary guy with a propensity to get into trouble in spite of himself: a dispute with his brother-in-law over a winning lottery ticket; a conflict with a wanted criminal over funeral urns; attempts to aid his elderly neighbour, his new tenant, and the ex he is still in love with, every time with unexpected (and certainly not positive) consequences.</p>

<br><br>- Oh no, are you kidding me?<br>Oh no! We're not the first!<br><br>- Don't worry,<br>it's going to be fine.<br><br>- What are we going to say?<br>- I dunno!<br><br>- I hate small talk!<br><br>- Look, just find yourself<br>3 or 4 basic questions, like...<br><br>- Like what?<br><br>- "Hey, did you buy a new boat?"<br><br>"Ever thought of getting a poodle?"<br><br>- OK great, what else?<br>- "Wow! Is that a new sofa?"<br><br>- I don't think he's got<br>this one in his collection.<br><br>I hope he'll like it!<br><br>- He'd better like it.<br>It's a 38$ bottle!<br><br>Why'd you put<br>a lottery ticket in there?<br><br>- Well, I picked the numbers<br>from his birthday.<br><br>And from his wedding anniversary...<br><br>And you know he loves money so...<br><br>I thought he'd like it...<br><br>- I hope you're not just<br>trying to impress him?<br><br>The bottle... the lottery ticket.<br>- Not at all!<br><br>- Not even a little bit?<br>- OK, yes, maybe just a little bit.<br><br>- Well, you know,<br>I'm glad that you like him.<br><br>Because all my exes,<br>they weren't really fond of Paul.<br><br>They thought that he didn't have a<br>shred of humanity.<br><br>- Well, I guess Paul is just<br>like your average rich asshole...<br><br>But who's still sort of likable.<br><br>- He has everything a man could want<br>don't you think?<br><br>- Of course not!<br><br>You're the one who's going out<br>with the prettiest of the 2 twins!<br><br>- Oh, yeah, you're right!<br>That's why I chose you honey.<br><br>- Oh, you're cute!<br>But I'm the one who chose you.<br><br>- Hello!<br>- Hey!<br><br>Wow! You guys are early... Come on in!<br><br>- So I started drinking a bit early.<br>But maybe it was a good thing,<br><br>because I'm not very good<br>with people I don't like.<br><br>But after a couple of drinks,<br>I get friendlier, you know.<br><br>But after a while,<br>even with 400$ bottles,<br><br>my stomach started<br>to get a little upset...<br><br>Especially since I don't have<br>a very high tolerance for alcohol.<br><br>So, the last thing<br>I remember : Blackout.<br><br>- Paul, calm down.<br>You're a bit drunk.<br><br>You mixed up the fours<br>with the twos and the fives.<br><br>And, that's fine!<br><br>You didn't win 2 million dollars!<br><br>Now, you're going to calm down<br>and look at the numbers again.<br><br>And I'm going to ask you<br>for 15 seconds of concentration.<br><br>15...15.<br><br>30... 30.<br><br>38... 38!<br><br>- Yeah?<br><br>- Guillaume, it's me.<br><br>I have a 2 million dollar<br>question for you.<br><br>- Go ahead.<br><br>- If I were to win at the lottery,<br>would I have to share with my wife?<br><br>- I already told you,<br><br>your wife has a right<br>to half of everything.<br><br>- Shit!<br><br>- You've won the jackpot,<br>you lucky son of a bitch?<br><br>Who gave you the ticket?<br><br>No one...<br><br>It's just the moron at my dealership<br>who forgot to fill up my new car.<br><br>So I had to stop at a gas station,<br>and the cashier was cute,<br><br>so I accepted her offer to buy<br>a lottery ticket and that's it.<br><br>- You didn't stop annoying<br>everyone at the office<br><br>that you were buying a Tesla.<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>- It's an electric car...<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>- Paul, let me tell you something<br>as your friend, not as your partner.<br><br>So listen to me carefully :<br><br>You have to give half the money to<br>the person who gave you that ticket.<br><br>- So first I have to give<br>half to my wife,<br><br>then half to the other dumb ass.<br><br>And you, since we're partners<br>and we share everything,<br><br>I also have to give you half.<br><br>And I wouldn't exist<br>without my parents.<br><br>So I'll give them their half too.<br><br>What am I talking about? They're<br>divorced! So it's one half each!<br><br>Come to think of it, maybe<br>I shouldn't claim the jackpot,<br><br>or I'll end up losing money!<br><br>- Add it up the way you want<br>but you have to share it.<br><br>- Or what?<br><br>- All your neighbors,<br>and your Facebook friends will think<br><br>that you're an egocentric narcissist<br>who only cares about money.<br><br>- Yeah... I guess I'd prefer<br>they didn't figure that out.<br><br>I'll call you back.<br>- OK.<br><br>- Go away!<br>- Paul? It's me, Francis!<br><br>I'm sorry, it's just that I sort<br>of clogged the downstairs toilet...<br><br>You wouldn't happen to have<br>a plunger by any chance?<br><br>- Yeah sure! Give me a minute.<br><br>- No problem.<br>Take your time, no rush!<br><br>- OK, Paul, you're going<br>to open the door...<br><br>you'll give him the plunger,<br><br>you're going to tell him :<br>"Francis, you're now a millionaire!"<br><br>He'll start crying like a baby.<br><br>You'll embrace him into your arms,<br><br>and everyone's going to be happy!<br><br>- Paul?<br><br>Are you all right?<br><br>- I've never been so ashamed...<br>- Ouch!<br><br>- Will you finally tell me,<br>what really happened?<br><br>- I told you! I was waiting<br>for Paul to get me a plunger.<br><br>Then he came out,<br>with his nose covered in blood<br><br>and he punched me<br>for no freaking reason!<br><br>- Bullshit!<br><br>I just spoke to my sister.<br><br>And she told me that Paul<br>showed you his new car.<br><br>You wanted to try it out,<br>but you were a little too drunk,<br><br>so obviously he wouldn't<br>let you drink and drive!<br><br>You tried to grab his keys,<br><br>he stopped you,<br>so you hit him in the face!<br><br>- Your brother-in-law<br>is freaking insane!<br><br>- That's what happened isn't it!?<br><br>- No!<br><br>- You gotta learn how<br>to hold your booze, buddy!<br><br>- So, if I understand<br>correctly, he stopped you<br><br>from driving his new car<br>because you were too drunk.<br><br>- I don't give a flying shit<br>about his cars!<br><br>He's the kind of maniac<br>who spends his weekends<br><br>cleaning his cars with a toothbrush.<br><br>I didn't want to have anything<br>to do with his cars.<br><br>Just imagine<br>if I borrowed one of them<br><br>and I came back with a small bug<br>stuck on his windshield!<br><br>He'd never let me hear<br>the end of it!<br><br>- On a scale of one to ten,<br><br>how much alcohol<br>do you usually take?<br><br>Ten being the highest.<br>- One.<br><br>I never drink... usually.<br><br>- And how often<br>do you resort to violence?<br><br>- Never! Zero.<br><br>I'm telling you,<br>I'm not a violent person.<br><br>Sometimes I can get carried away,<br>but worst case scenario...<br><br>I get carried away with my words.<br><br>- OK, keep that in mind,<br>we'll get back to it later.<br><br>So after your mother passed away,<br><br>you found someone to sublet<br>her apartment.<br><br>- Excuse me, but it's sort of weird<br><br>to go back and forth like this,<br>don't you think?<br><br>Is it? Is it really necessary?<br><br>- It's the way I work,<br>it's my method...<br><br>- OK, I get it, you're trying<br>to find out if I'm lying.<br><br>Because you know that when you<br>mix up different events together...<br><br>Skip between different<br>timelines and all,<br><br>a liar is more likely to get<br>confused in all his lies.<br><br>But I'm not a liar, I swear!<br><br>- Calm down!<br>I call the shots in here.<br><br>Let me do my job the way I see fit.<br><br>- You're right. Sorry...<br><br>- I'd like you to tell me<br><br>what happened<br>with your upstairs neighbor.<br><br>- Well, it's quite simple really :<br>she screwed me!<br><br>Obviously, the whole place<br>pis due for a bit of a makeover...<br><br>My mom lived here almost<br>all her life you know.<br><br>That's the bed she got<br>for her wedding.<br><br>- Hey, does that mean<br>that you were conceived here?<br><br>- Oh yeah...<br><br>Yeah... I don't really want<br>to think about that!<br><br>- It must have been a shock...<br>to lose your mother like this.<br><br>- Yeah, I guess... You're never really<br>ready for that.<br><br>- Yup! I'll take it.<br><br>- The place is all yours...<br>as soon as I clear it out.<br><br>- You know what?<br><br>There's just one little thing<br>that I'd like to ask you.<br><br>- Uh, OK, like what?<br><br>- I just can't believe that<br><br>you'd sublet the apartment at the<br>same price that your mother paid.<br><br>It's not normal that our<br>rent is higher than hers!<br><br>- I know, but my mom lived<br>there all her life...<br><br>- Exactly why you should've tried<br>to make a profit on the sublet.<br><br>You're really hopeless when<br>it comes to business!<br><br>- You know, honey, just tell<br>yourself that we're lucky<br><br>to have found someone to<br>take back the lease.<br><br>- What are we gonna do<br>with your mom's stuff?<br><br>- I... left her the furniture.<br><br>- For how much?<br><br>- For nothing.<br><br>- Come on, Francis! You could've at<br>least sold it to her...<br><br>- I wanted to be generous. OK?<br><br>That girl hasn't had it<br>easy in life.<br><br>You know, her Ex left her,<br>he had the condo in his own name,<br><br>and left her with nothing ...<br><br>- Oh, you're such a nice guy!<br><br>I think she's all alone tonight.<br><br>Why don't go join her<br><br>and cuddle with her<br>in your mother's bed?<br><br>- Ah, you don't get it!<br><br>- Don't you think she's cute?<br><br>- Come on honey that's not it, it's<br>just that... I think we're cheap!<br><br>When was the last time that<br>we gave money to a charity?<br><br>Or even just a buck or two<br>at the grocery store?<br><br>- Well, we went to a fundraising<br>dinner just 3 months ago.<br><br>I remember, the ticketswere so<br>freaking expensive,<br><br>for shitty cafeteria food.<br><br>- Uh, you know<br>your expensive tickets...<br><br>your boss gave them to us.<br><br>- Oh yeah that's right. I forgot...<br><br>- Excuse me, did I say<br>something wrong?<br><br>- No, not at all, on the contrary!<br>- OK, sorry.<br><br>- You seem like a generous person.<br>It's something rare nowadays.<br><br>But in general,<br><br>people who give a lot usually<br>expect something in return.<br><br>- Yeah, but that's a plan<br>to be disappointed isn't it?<br><br>- Hum. Tell me all about your<br>encounter with Daniel Couture.<br><br>Why?<br><br>- Part of my job here,<br>pis to dig through your past.<br><br>To make sure that you really are<br>the person that you claim to be.<br><br>That's my job. Do you get it?<br><br>- Yes, yes, I'm sorry sir.<br>- Great.<br><br>Now, tell me all<br>about Daniel Couture.<br><br>- Eh boy!<br><br>So I had my bat<br>and I was ready to strike.<br><br>I wasn't really myself,<br>you understand...<br><br>- OK, stop. You're going a little<br>too fast. Hum? Calm down.<br><br>You're gonna start over<br>from the beginning. OK?<br><br>- From the start? Really?<br><br>- Yeah! Just act as if I didn't know<br>anything from your case.<br><br>- OK...<br><br>Well, Annie had just broken up<br>with me. So I went to see my mom,<br><br>because it cheers me up<br>when I talk to my mom.<br><br>Hey mom, I can't believe<br>it's already been a year.<br><br>Yeah, you're... you're surprised<br>to see me here, huh?<br><br>Well... I took the afternoon off,<br>to spend it with you.<br><br>Just the two of us!<br><br>It's been so long since<br>we've had time to chat.<br><br>I have so much stuff to tell you!<br><br>You know, the... the food<br>processor you gave me?<br><br>Well, a little piece<br>of it just broke.<br><br>And I can't use it anymore...<br>And I know it's silly...<br><br>but it's almost like if there was<br>little a piece of you<br><br>that I lost at the same time...<br><br>Not that you're like a food<br>processor, but you were so...<br><br>You know, you loved to cook so much.<br><br>So I applied for a new job<br>last week, it's at a Zoo...<br><br>Hello!<br>- Hum hum.<br><br>Sorry, it's... it's because<br>my father's right there.<br><br>- Hey, what's the odds, huh? I mean...<br><br>Well, go... go ahead, I... I'll...<br><br>- I won't be long.<br><br>- Ah, no rush,<br>I have the whole afternoon!<br><br>It's all good.<br><br>- Hey there, you old piece of shit!<br>This is my new fiancée.<br><br>Maurice, Honeybun.<br>Honeybun, Maurice.<br><br>- Nice to meet you, Maurice.<br><br>Dan told me a lot of<br>bad stuff about you.<br><br>- Daniel? Daniel Couture?<br><br>I'm so happy to put a face<br>on your beard.<br><br>I mean, a face on your name.<br><br>Because I come here<br>all the time to see my mother,<br><br>and I always take the time<br>to say hi to all her neighbors.<br><br>And I usually have a quick<br>chat with your father.<br><br>He's a sharp man, really.<br><br>- Is your name Daniel Couture<br>or Dan Kelly?<br><br>- I took my mother's name.<br><br>- What are you taking about?<br>Your mother's a Laviolette.<br><br>It's written ... it's right there...<br><br>Hey... Calm down dude...<br><br>I didn't want to meddle...<br><br>- Look, I don't really<br>want to know.<br><br>Anyway I'd rather be<br>a Mrs. Kelly than a Mrs. Couture.<br><br>- Come on, let's get out of here.<br>- Hold on babe!<br><br>We have a little<br>father & son ritual.<br><br>- What! Are you kidding<br>me right now?<br><br>Ark!<br><br>Sorry, but right now you have<br>your cock in my mother's face!<br><br>Would it be possible to stick it<br>back in your pants, please?<br><br>I can't believe what you're doing!<br><br>I just can't believe it! Come on!<br>- Don't worry.<br><br>It's just like cat litter.<br>It absorbs bad smells.<br><br>- It's been 8 years since<br>he's passed. Let it go!<br><br>- No, he's still here!<br><br>I can still hear his God<br>damn voice in my head.<br><br>Every day he tells me<br>that I am a fucking failure.<br><br>A loser and a disappointment.<br><br>On top of that, he's<br>ashamed of what I do!<br><br>- Well, from what I just saw,<br>he's got a good reason to be.<br><br>- Are you saying that<br>my father's right?<br><br>- No, no, I'm just saying that there<br>are some things that you can't do...<br><br>like urinate in an urn.<br><br>- He thinks my father's right!<br><br>- Choose your battles.<br>- You bet!<br><br>You know, when I was little,<br>we were 12 children in the family.<br><br>So when there was<br>a problem, my father,<br><br>he didn't have very much<br>time to talk with us<br><br>and go through his emotions.<br><br>His only way of talking<br>to us was with his fists.<br><br>- Ah, that sucks... but the good news<br>is, that you're an improved version.<br><br>You're able to talk.<br>- Not really.<br><br>- Excuse me, madam.<br><br>- So when you came out of the<br>mausoleum, you took your car,<br><br>and you followed him to his house.<br><br>And then you called the police?<br><br>- Uh... more or less<br><br>- How impulsive are you usually?<br><br>- Not really,<br>but when it comes to my mother,<br><br>I can be a little sensitive.<br><br>- You wanted revenge?<br><br>- My mother was a saint, OK?<br>She's never done anything wrong.<br><br>And she spent all her<br>time helping out others.<br><br>So I think that she<br>deserves some respect.<br><br>- You didn't really go<br>into details earlier<br><br>when you mentioned your<br>break up with Annie.<br><br>So I'd like you to go over it again.<br><br>Because you know in the police<br>report, it's a very detailed event.<br><br>- Annie, um... she really was...<br><br>my worst heartbreak ever.<br><br>I didn't recognize myself anymore.<br><br>I'd become possessive, jealous.<br><br>But, it won't happen again.<br><br>- You bet it won't!<br><br>- Not him again!<br><br>What?<br><br>- I miss you!<br><br>- Hey, get over it! It's been<br>6 months. I'm with Steve now.<br><br>- We just have one<br>life to live, right?<br><br>- Yeah, so?<br><br>- We get ourselves<br>2 tickets for Vegas,<br><br>we rent a small condo<br>next to Celine's house,<br><br>we get married and we have children.<br><br>- Great! Now, you listen<br>to me very carefully, OK?<br><br>- Sure, whatever you want, honey.<br><br>- You need help!<br><br>You're sick!<br>- You think?<br><br>- I don't think so, I'm sure of it!<br><br>They'll give you antidepressants<br>or something like that.<br><br>- OK, I... I'll go to the doctor's.<br><br>But in the meantime, I wrote you a<br>poem. Can I read it to you?<br><br>- I don't give a shit.<br><br>- Giraffe sedative with eucalyptus.<br><br>No, I can't take that<br>stuff, it's too strong!<br><br>Ah, it's organic, it must be OK.<br><br>Ah... tastes like shit!<br><br>- On a scale from 1 to 10, how much<br>would you rate your drug use?<br><br>- Zero! I don't do drugs...<br><br>- OK.<br>- Never, I'm serious!<br><br>- And what about giraffe sedatives?<br><br>In which category<br>should I label that?<br><br>- Natural organic products?<br><br>- By the way, I can see here<br><br>that you've been seeing a shrink<br>ever since you were 18.<br><br>- Yeah... you know at one<br>point in my life, I decided<br><br>that I wasn't going to be<br>one of those guys who...<br><br>dump all their shit on others<br>and annoy everyone<br><br>with their unresolved<br>problems from childhood.<br><br>So whenever I feel down I'd rather<br>give my money to a shrink<br><br>so that I don't have to be<br>a downer to everyone else.<br><br>- That's very wise.<br><br>- Thanks!<br><br>- Hi?<br><br>What the fuck!?<br><br>- Naughty girl!<br><br>- Hey! What the hell are you doing?<br><br>- Come on! Snatchbook!<br><br>- Snatchbook?<br>- Yeah!<br><br>- Sorry, it must be the girl<br>upstairs... Cynthia?<br><br>Yeah...<br><br>OK, hey, I'm so sorry.<br><br>- Are you OK, honey?<br><br>- Yes, darling, everything's fine!<br><br>- OK, I'm really sorry. I...<br><br>- Yes... it's upstairs.<br><br>- OK.<br>- Have a good day!<br><br>- Yeah, you too, ma'am.<br><br>- What're you doing?<br>- Hey, check this out.<br><br>It's like a dating app just for<br>people who want to fuck!<br><br>- Snatchbook?<br><br>OK, uh, and what are all these red<br>dots around our place?<br><br>- Well, that's everyone<br>that's um... available.<br><br>- To fuck? Right now?<br><br>- Yeah. Less than 5 minutes away!<br><br>- Are you kidding me?<br><br>- What's the world become!<br>It's crazy. It's degrading!<br><br>- Yes, yes, it's really<br>lowering mankind<br><br>to its most primary instincts, huh...<br><br>No, really that's just<br>putting love aside<br><br>and reducing everything<br>to pure sexual contact.<br><br>No, no, no, hey,<br>we're not sex dolls!<br><br>- Honey...<br><br>... admit it! It turns<br>you on doesn't it?<br><br>- It's amazing, sweetheart!<br><br>It's like a dream come true.<br>You can fuck on demand!<br><br>You know, it used to be<br>that you'd have<br><br>to drive up to an hour and a half<br>to have a fling with a girl.<br><br>Don't tell me that was<br>good for the planet!<br><br>Nowadays, you can go<br>by foot... in a dressing gown.<br><br>It's fantastic!<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>Good night honey!<br><br>- You don't think I'm right?<br><br>You're the one who's always saying<br><br>that we should get<br>more local products!<br><br>-Um hum.<br><br>- In any case,<br>one thing is for certain,<br><br>you're not someone who is<br>very stable in relationships.<br><br>Over the last three years,<br><br>you've been with Melissa, Julie,<br><br>Annie, Solange...<br><br>- No with Solange, it wasn't...<br><br>I've never... All I wanted<br>was to help her.<br><br>- Oh, you wanted to help her, sure,<br><br>but your name's<br>all over the police report.<br><br>And even Solange's own son is<br>accusing you of forcing his mother<br><br>to change her last will<br>in your favor.<br><br>- No! I mean, yes,<br>but I didn't force her.<br><br>- You didn't?<br><br>- She did it<br>all by herself, I swear.<br><br>Solange, are you OK?<br><br>- They stole my engine...<br>damn thieves!<br><br>- Your engine?<br><br>Solange... You're engine's<br>right there!<br><br>- That's not my engine!<br><br>Before I went to the mechanic<br>yesterday, I had a V8.<br><br>And when I came back I had a V6.<br><br>- Well, hum, OK, but... how is it less<br>efficient, I mean, your engine?<br><br>- It doesn't have any torque.<br>It doesn't have any power!<br><br>- So, you're saying that your<br>mechanic went through the trouble<br><br>of removing your old engine and<br>replacing it with a cheaper one?<br><br>- Precisely!<br><br>It's not everyone who paid for the<br>upgrade! A V8 engine is extra.<br><br>My Stephen, he worked overtime<br>to afford that V8.<br><br>- And did you tell your mechanic?<br><br>- Of course, I told him!<br><br>He gave me a lousy explanation.<br>He made it seem like I was crazy.<br><br>So, I called him a dirty thief and I<br>left without settling his bill.<br><br>- Solange! Get real,<br>no one stole your engine.<br><br>- You don't believe me?<br><br>- It's not that I don't believe you,<br>it's just that it isn't possible.<br><br>You know it's the same with humans,<br><br>as we get older, our<br>cells sort of stretch.<br><br>We get slower... you know,<br>huh, we're not as fast.<br><br>I guess that's not all news to you...<br><br>Well with a car's engine,<br>it's pretty much the same...<br><br>Your engine is just tired.<br><br>- You disappoint me Francis.<br>If only my Stephen was still here...<br><br>he never would've let that slide.<br><br>Take care...<br><br>- It's a V8!<br><br>God damn crooked mechanic!<br><br>- What do you want with me?<br>- You know what I want!<br><br>- So you believed her story?<br><br>- Well, I did some<br>research... on Google<br><br>and I found out that V8 models,<br>well, they come with V8 engines.<br><br>The V6 models come with V6<br>engines, and the V4...<br><br>- OK... OK I get the picture.<br><br>- Great! So perhaps now you<br>could try to explain how come<br><br>Solange has a V6 in her V8?<br><br>- I asked around to my guys<br>this morning and no one knows.<br><br>- But you've got to admit<br>it's a bit odd, right?<br><br>- Listen, you're not the only one<br><br>who'd like to figure out<br>what happened.<br><br>- Since Solange's engine<br>went missing<br><br>while her car was in your garage,<br><br>I just happen to have this feeling<br><br>that you're the one<br>who's responsible.<br><br>So we're going to try to<br>keep things simple, OK,<br><br>you'll just go ahead and replace<br>her engine with a new one.<br><br>- Are you crazy? A V8 is<br>worth at least 7000 bucks!<br><br>- Ha! You know its price!<br><br>- Of course I know its price, that's<br>my job. It doesn't mean I'm guilty.<br><br>- OK, look, personally,<br>I don't give a rat's ass<br><br>if Solange drives around<br>with a V6 in her V8.<br><br>If it were up to me,<br>she could strut around on a scooter<br><br>while drinking V8.<br><br>As long as she's happy,<br>I don't give a shit!<br><br>The only thing that pisses me off is<br>that crooked mechanics like you<br><br>rip off helpless people<br><br>while thinking that no<br>one will ever notice it.<br><br>That, truly disgusts me!<br>I can't live with that.<br><br>I don't sleep well at night<br>because of things like that.<br><br>- So you accuse me of being a crook!<br><br>While I bust my agent Sans-Secret<br>every day for my clients<br><br>instead of being home<br>with my children.<br><br>That really pisses me off!<br><br>- Very touching story.<br><br>- If you're so convinced,<br>then just sue me.<br><br>- Great idea! I'll sue you.<br><br>- You don't have any proof anyway.<br><br>- Uh, yes I do! I have<br>Solange's car as proof.<br><br>- OK, 8 o'clock tomorrow<br>morning, bring me her car.<br><br>- That's much better!<br><br>-Yes?<br><br>Hum hum.<br><br>Yeah, he's right here<br>in front of me.<br><br>OK... Very well, thanks.<br><br>We just received your lab results.<br><br>It's negative...<br><br>- Oh! Great... that's really great!<br><br>- You seem relieved.<br><br>Were you afraid<br>that we'd find something?<br><br>- Oh, no, no, no! I know I'm clean.<br><br>It's just nice to... make<br>it official, you know.<br><br>- Hum hum.<br><br>- Hey... Hey!<br><br>This is going to be<br>the most important apology<br><br>of your whole life!<br><br>- Winner of the two<br>million dollar jackpot?<br><br>- Yes! Yes!<br>- No no no!<br><br>- "Should I share with<br>my brother-in-law?"<br><br>"Don't give him a penny, keep<br>the money, let him rot in hell."<br><br>I think I just understood<br>what happened last night.<br><br>- I don't care what you understand,<br>and what you don't understand,<br><br>you're going to put your<br>ego aside for once<br><br>you're going to call him<br>right now to apologize!<br><br>Don't forget that you're<br>deeply sorry for everything.<br><br>You put some real heart into it<br>and then you congratulate him!<br><br>- Congratulate him?<br>- Yes!<br><br>- I'm the one who bought the ticket!<br><br>He's the one who should be<br>here kissing my ass.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>- Hi there you greedy asshole!<br>How are you doing this morning?<br><br>- Ah, try to put yourself<br>in my shoes, Francis.<br><br>I go to the washroom...<br><br>I take a look at the<br>lottery numbers on my phone.<br><br>And I notice that I just<br>won 2 million dollars, eh.<br><br>And the only thing I was wondering<br>while I was glaring at my ticket,<br><br>was trying to figure out<br>a way to make sure<br><br>that I wouldn't have to give<br>you a God damn penny!<br><br>After that, well, you know the rest.<br><br>- If you didn't want to share, you<br>didn't have to punch me in the face!<br><br>- Oh, that's because<br>I needed to make sure<br><br>that my friends would understand<br><br>why I wouldn't share<br>the jackpot with you.<br><br>- You know what? You're<br>fucking insane man!<br><br>- You know it's all<br>your fault, right?<br><br>If you hadn't given me a ticket,<br><br>I wouldn't have had to choose<br>between your friendship and money.<br><br>- Ark!<br><br>- That's why I'm<br>successful in life.<br><br>I never mix family with business.<br><br>- That's so true.<br><br>- I'm sorry I didn't<br>believe you before.<br><br>- I don't know if I'll be<br>able to continue living<br><br>knowing that we gave 2 million to<br>the worst asshole in the universe.<br><br>- Me neither...<br><br>My sister...<br><br>My sister, she can<br>make this right!<br><br>- You're wasting your time.<br>Your sister isn't going to help us.<br><br>- How much is it really worth,<br>your relationship with your sister?<br><br>Think about it.<br><br>- You know, she owes<br>everything to Paul.<br><br>She'll do anything to stay with him!<br><br>- She wants to play dirty?<br>Well, I can play dirty too!<br><br>- Fuck me!<br><br>- Guillaume?<br><br>Isn't that Paul's partner?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Hey, you know, your sister...<br>she's just a slut.<br><br>- I know.<br><br>But Guillaume, you know<br>he's... well equipped.<br><br>- What about you, did<br>you sleep with him too?<br><br>- Yeah...<br><br>But that was before<br>I was with you.<br><br>- You can't betray me like that!<br><br>We swore that we'd<br>never tell anyone.<br><br>It was a secret between sisters!<br><br>You want to fuck up my<br>marriage, is that it?<br><br>You're just jealous!<br><br>Do you want me to<br>tell you something?<br><br>If only you'd listened<br>to mom and dad<br><br>and you'd found yourself<br>a rich husband,<br><br>not a God damn loser<br>like your boyfriend.<br><br>Well, we wouldn't<br>be in this situation!<br><br>You really want to<br>fuck up my marriage?<br><br>Well tell him you<br>backstabbing bitch!<br><br>- Its settled...<br><br>We won't get a penny... and I never<br>want to see my sister again.<br><br>- When you think about<br>it... she may be right.<br><br>Why are you with a guy like me?<br><br>- Because I love you...<br>and I know that you love me.<br><br>And we don't really need<br>that much money to be happy, do we?<br><br>- Yes. Well, I mean,<br>we can live without it, but...<br><br>- I mean think about it,<br><br>we've never been as unhappy<br>as we've been since this morning.<br><br>- That's true.<br><br>Come to think of it, if it<br>hadn't been for his birthday,<br><br>I never would've bought<br>that lottery ticket.<br><br>- Good point!<br><br>- I love your bungalow.<br><br>-And I love<br>your old Volvo!<br><br>- We don't need anything else.<br>- That's so true!<br><br>- You know what... they<br>should keep the money!<br><br>They need it more than we do!<br>- Right on!<br><br>In the end I guess...<br><br>it's a good thing.<br><br>- It's a great thing,<br>because I love you honey!<br><br>- I love you too!<br><br>- The only thing that sucks, is that<br>you're supposed to deserve a gift.<br><br>- Holy shit... you're onto something!<br><br>What?<br><br>- "Deserve"? Is that what you said?<br>- Yeah...<br><br>- And they don't deserve it!<br><br>We're going to get our ticket.<br>- What do you mean?<br><br>- We're gonna get<br>our ticket back!<br><br>It's ours!<br><br>- You have 2 seconds<br>to apologize to my mom.<br><br>"NO!"<br><br>Sorry? I didn't hear you.<br><br>"You heard me! When I<br>was young, my father..."”<br><br>I know, your father hit you<br>and I don't give a shit!<br><br>"You're just a little skinny loser<br><br>"who used to get his ass<br>kicked in the schoolyard.<br><br>"And it's still the same today,<br>you're a God damn coward.”<br><br>You're right! But that just changed.<br><br>Sorry, I can't hear you.<br><br>Oh, you'd like to apologize,<br>but you can't speak anymore?<br><br>So sad!<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>He needs to apologize to my mother.<br><br>- Forget it. Dan is never<br>going to apologize.<br><br>You don't get it do you?<br><br>Deep inside Dan is just<br>an injured little boy<br><br>who needs to be loved.<br><br>- Ah, OK! That changes everything,<br>you could've told me before.<br><br>Silly me! Here I thought that<br>he was just a crazy psycho<br><br>who couldn't control<br>his own emotions<br><br>and who was always looking<br>to pick a fight!<br><br>I'm not leaving here<br>without an apology!<br><br>- I beg you, please!<br><br>I'm sure that you're<br>smarter than this!<br><br>Give me your bat.<br><br>- Mike, she knows my real name :<br>Daniel Couture.<br><br>- I still don't understand why<br>you brought her there.<br><br>- I told you, she really<br>wanted to meet my father.<br><br>- Your father's dead!<br><br>- Do you think<br>I don't fucking know that?<br><br>I'm the one who freaking killed him!<br><br>- You have 2 choices:<br>either you get rid of her<br><br>or you jump on a plane and you<br>two get the fuck out of here.<br><br>- Listen, I know that my new<br>identity was expensive<br><br>but I really love this girl, OK?<br><br>Tell that to the boss.<br><br>I'm going to run some errands.<br><br>I'll have a little surprise<br>for you when I come back.<br><br>- Well...<br>- Hum?<br><br>- I'd really like you to apologize<br>for what you did earlier.<br><br>- You're right. I'm sorry...<br><br>You never should've met my father!<br><br>- Hold on!<br><br>Thank you...<br>- Don't thank me.<br><br>I'm going to do what I should've<br>done from the start :<br><br>I'll go straight to the police.<br><br>I know that you love him,<br>but he's a God damn psychopath.<br><br>And he should be locked up.<br>He's a... Pfff! You know.<br><br>Solange, where's your car?<br>- I don't know...<br><br>- That fat fucking fucker!<br>God damn crooked ass hole!<br><br>There you have it!<br><br>Yes sir!<br><br>Yes hi, I'd like to report a<br>vehicle theft, please,<br><br>at 4224 Remembrance.<br><br>Yeah, and I can even describe<br>the suspect to you if you want.<br><br>He's currently wearing jeans<br>and some kind of ugly jacket.<br><br>Would you like to talk to him?<br><br>OK, so hurry up please!<br><br>It's the police,<br>they're on their way!<br><br>- Sure... Do you want to know<br>what happened here?<br><br>- No need! I know exactly<br>what happened.<br><br>You tried to get rid of the<br>evidence and you got caught!<br><br>So now you look like<br>a guilty dumb ass!<br><br>By the way, it's two<br>separate thefts!<br><br>The engine and<br>then the car!<br><br>So you're going to be<br>charged for both, big guy.<br><br>Well, I say big, but<br>you're not that tall.<br><br>More like a... fat gnome.<br>A... hairy leprechaun...<br><br>A mini Hagrid!<br><br>- Police custody.<br><br>Last night, Solange...<br>she got chased by a police car.<br><br>She drove through<br>at least two red lights<br><br>and it took a roadblock<br>to finally stop her.<br><br>Have a look!<br><br>- Oh, shit!<br><br>- By the way, I found the answer<br>to your engine problem.<br><br>When you're too cheap to buy a V8,<br><br>you just get a sticker,<br>it's a lot cheaper!<br><br>Anything to say about that?<br><br>- Well, I guess it's all<br>good. It's... it's great.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>I don't know what to say...<br>- There's nothing to say...<br><br>- Cool, well, let's not<br>say anything then.<br><br>- Perfect. Bye!<br>- I'm going to fuck off then.<br><br>I'm just going to grab<br>my bike if you don't mind.<br><br>- Yeah... whatever.<br>- I'll just go through there.<br><br>- Who's the dumb ass now?<br><br>- Did you find my car?<br><br>- Solange, why didn't you tell me<br>that you'd ran away from the police?<br><br>- You didn't ask me.<br><br>You wanted to know where my car was.<br>I told you, I don't know.<br><br>- Solange, it's been 2 years since<br>you've lost your driver's licence.<br><br>It's over, now.<br><br>- If only I'd had my V8,<br><br>the cops never would've<br>caught up with me.<br><br>I want my car back.<br><br>- Forget it, your car's<br>been impounded.<br><br>- It's the last gift<br>that my husband gave me.<br><br>I want it back in my driveway!<br><br>- It's not happening!<br><br>- Take the money from my safe.<br><br>Bribe the police chief or whoever<br>you need... I want my car back.<br><br>- Sure, and who's going to drive it?<br><br>- It's been like this for a week.<br>I can't bare it any longer!<br><br>- Sure, why don't you just<br>go upstairs<br><br>and ask them to fuck quietly.<br><br>- Hello, lovebirds!<br><br>"What's up?"<br><br>- She's texting & fucking<br>at the same time!<br><br>- It's better than texting<br>and driving I guess.<br><br>"Are we making too much noise?"<br><br>A little bit.<br><br>"Is that better ?"<br><br>Much...<br><br>Much... better!<br><br>- We should've done that way sooner.<br><br>- What are we gonna do<br>about the bed?<br><br>"Have a good night!"<br><br>- OK, Mike, you know<br>that you're my best,<br><br>but right now I've got<br>a really big problem.<br><br>Can you tell me why your guy<br>was a no-show this morning?<br><br>He was supposed to bring<br>the passports across the border.<br><br>- I told you, I'm already on it.<br><br>It's just that my usual guy's<br>in the hospital right now.<br><br>- You know our clients, they<br>paid us a shitload of money<br><br>so that we'd help them<br>get away from Donald.<br><br>- I know...<br><br>Well find someone as<br>soon as fucking possible!<br><br>- I'm on it, don't worry.<br><br>Just give me<br>a little bit more time, OK?<br><br>"Cynthia : I'm at the bus<br>stop, come get me"”<br><br>- What are you up to?<br>- Just hold on one second babe.<br><br>I'll be right back.<br>- OK.<br><br>- You can open your eyes.<br><br>- Oh honey!<br><br>What's the occasion?<br><br>- Well, it's been a full<br>week since we've met.<br><br>It's the first time that<br><br>I've been with the<br>same girl for so long.<br><br>- And you're not tired of me?<br>- No, on the contrary!<br><br>I'd like to come<br>and live with you.<br><br>- I was hoping you'd ask!<br>- Huh?<br><br>- I was waiting for that!<br><br>Wait, let's celebrate<br>this properly.<br><br>- Hum, hum, hum!<br><br>Hello mister!<br><br>- Hi! Hello...<br><br>- Honeybun, I've<br>got your surprise.<br><br>Honeybun?<br><br>Come on, pick up!<br><br>Fucking bitch!<br><br>She's gone.<br><br>- Gone to heaven?<br><br>- No, she just left.<br><br>- You let her go!?<br><br>- No, no, I went<br>to get my Kit.<br><br>I didn't want it to get blood<br>and shit everywhere.<br><br>It's my house God damn it!<br><br>- OK, I'll check with<br>the cab dispatch<br><br>and call you back in ten.<br><br>- Good.<br><br>Watermelon!<br><br>- Good day!<br><br>Let me guess, you want a refund ?<br><br>- Not really.<br><br>Listen, sir, there's a stranger<br>in our neighborhood<br><br>and he's been giving<br>toys to young children...<br><br>and he gave this to my<br>6 year old yesterday.<br><br>My wife and I fear that<br>he may be a kidnapper<br><br>so we'd like to<br>know his name to...<br><br>well let's just say we'd<br>like to talk to him.<br><br>- Looks like we only sold<br>one in the last month<br><br>and it was paid<br>with a credit card.<br><br>But... without a warrant.<br><br>I can't really give you any<br>personal information.<br><br>You know, it's confidential.<br><br>- I'm sure you could make<br>a tiny exception in this case.<br><br>Not really, no.<br><br>Listen, I finish my<br>work shift in 2 minutes,<br><br>is there anything else I<br>could help you with?<br><br>- Sure, could I talk to<br>the fucking manager?<br><br>- I'm the fucking manager!<br><br>- Come on, just give a<br>concerned father a break.<br><br>- You're not listening,<br>sir, it's store policy.<br><br>It's confidential, I can't<br>do anything about it.<br><br>- And what if I shoved this<br>fucking bat up your ass?<br><br>- I can't give you his name.<br><br>But maybe I could<br>give you his address.<br><br>- It seems to me that before<br>moving into a new apartment,<br><br>You ask if you're allowed to<br>bring your God damn dog first.<br><br>Ah! Here it is!<br><br>It's right here on the lease.<br><br>"No pets allowed.”<br><br>- Honey, it's only temporary.<br><br>His brother's going to come and get<br>the dog in about a week or so.<br><br>- But why doesn't he just bring<br>the dog to his brother himself.<br><br>- Because he's got<br>a criminal record.<br><br>They won't let him cross the border<br>and his brother lives in the States.<br><br>- What about his girlfriend?<br>- Cynthia? You've seen her.<br><br>She doesn't even know how to drive!<br><br>- Well, you know what, I<br>think I'm going to stay at a motel<br><br>until this<br>whole thing is settled.<br><br>- Honey, it's OK,<br>I'll take care of it!<br><br>I'll take the dog<br>to the States myself.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>- Hey!<br><br>- Hello, my sweet Francis!<br><br>- Solange, what are you doing?<br><br>- I'm waiting for my Stephen.<br>We're going on a picnic.<br><br>- Solange, he won't be coming...<br><br>What about you?<br><br>- Your sad to let him go, huh?<br>- I'll miss him.<br><br>I'm just happy to know that<br>he'll be in good hands.<br><br>My brother is a dog-lover!<br><br>What do you think, Peanuts? You're<br>going to be happy in the States?<br><br>- I found this in<br>your jeans earlier.<br><br>You got him 2 days<br>ago from the pet shop.<br><br>And his name is Swirly.<br><br>What are you playing at?<br><br>- That's how I earn a living.<br><br>- Using clueless people to smuggle<br>fake Ids through the border?<br><br>I'm telling you, no way!<br><br>Francis, is a good guy.<br><br>- Don't worry, I've done it<br>dozens of times<br><br>and no one ever<br>got caught so...<br><br>- Great, but don't<br>use Francis, OK?<br><br>Find someone else.<br><br>- I don't have enough time.<br><br>This is my last time,<br>OK? I promise you.<br><br>- No, I can't let you do it.<br><br>- But he won't get caught.<br><br>He doesn't have a record,<br>he's not wanted by the cops,<br><br>and he doesn't know anything,<br><br>so... he won't look worried<br>when he'll get through customs.<br><br>- Sure, but what if<br>he gets caught?<br><br>How long will he get?<br><br>- Seven years in jail.<br><br>Well, look, we... let's<br>not think about that.<br><br>Think of all the refugees<br>that we can help instead.<br><br>There are people who are caught<br>in bad situations in life,<br><br>and they need a fresh start.<br><br>And we can give them<br>that second chance.<br><br>- OK, cut the bullshit!<br><br>How much are you making?<br><br>- You mean...<br><br>how much are we making?<br><br>It's a grand per passport.<br>We've got 50.<br><br>But if you really don't<br>want me to do it... well I won't...<br><br>- If I'm not back in 5 minutes,<br>call the cops.<br><br>- Sweetheart! Are you<br>sure that's a good idea?<br><br>- We're not losing<br>2 million dollars today!<br><br>- Stay calm, Francis!<br><br>Stay calm, it's nothing,<br>it's just 2 million.<br><br>It won't change your life.<br><br>Calm down...<br><br>Just breathe.<br>Be mindful!<br><br>- I got it!<br><br>- You're kidding!<br>How did you...?<br><br>- Her marriage is worth<br>more than 2 million.<br><br>- It's the...<br>it's the worst<br><br>and the happiest day of<br>my life at the same time!<br><br>- Me too!<br><br>- I don't know why, but I'm<br>really turned on right now!<br><br>- Me too!<br><br>- Who is it?<br><br>- It's... she has it!<br><br>- Sure, but you can<br>have it back, here...<br><br>we don't really need that<br>much money anyway.<br><br>- I heard my wife<br>talking to you.<br><br>She said, "Promise me that<br>you'll never tell my husband.”<br><br>Tell me who it is!<br><br>- Hey...

word ofr me with Britt.<br><br>- She doesn't like you.<br><br>- Like that matters.<br><br>- God.<br><br>- I rode the back way<br>past the Baldwin place<br><br>and they're fixing it up for<br>the Halloween house again.<br><br>And there's like a<br>shit ton of copper wire<br><br>just lying around.<br><br>- That's crazy.<br><br>- Yeah, my mom's psycho<br>boyfriend knows a guy<br><br>who could probably buy<br>it, no questions asked.<br><br>I bet I could get a<br>hundred bucks for it, easy.<br><br>50 bucks for me, 50 for you.<br><br>- Damn, so that<br>was your big plan?<br><br>- How else are

we're gonna<br>knock on the door.<br><br>When the guy checks<br>to go see who it is,<br><br>that's when you go and<br>sneak and grab the wire.<br><br>- That could work, right Wyatt?<br><br>Just like ding dong ditch.<br><br>- Do you wanna keep<br>your phone or not?<br><br>I need you to be my wing man.<br><br>- Sure!<br><br>What's a wing man?<br><br>- Just go up to the window<br><br>and tell me what you see.<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Uh, I see someone!<br><br>- Go, go!<br><br>Jolie!<br><br>- It's too early in the<br>morning for this shit.<br><br>- What the hell?<br><br>-

back.<br><br>- Are you out of<br>your mind, dude?<br><br>No, I'm taking Jolie home<br><br>and we're gonna forget<br>that we were even there<br><br>and we're not gonna tell<br>anyone that that ever happened.<br><br>And so should you, dude.<br><br>Get your bike, Jolie.<br><br>- Fine.<br><br>Whatever, I don't care anyways.<br><br>- I don't know<br>where else to look.<br><br>I should have made<br>Jolie come with me.<br><br>- Okay, so now what?<br><br>- I literally have no<br>idea where they could be.<br><br>- Probably just out like<br>stealing beers or reading porn.<br><br>- Yeah, Robby, maybe.<br><br>But Wyatt, no way,<br>not with Jolie around.<br><br>- I don't get why<br>it's such a big deal.<br><br>You guys aren't even related.<br><br>- It's important to me.<br><br>- You're<br>just the babysitter.<br><br>- They're important to me.<br><br>- At least someone is.<br><br>- What does that mean?<br><br>Wyatt?<br><br>No, sorry.<br><br>We still haven't found

purpose!<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>Bye!<br><br>Bye, run!<br><br>That's the only thing that<br>you're fucking good at!<br><br>- Babe, why don't you go?<br><br>I got this.<br><br>- Want me to come by

papers<br>for your mom, hmm?<br><br>- Yeah, hey, Mr. Meredith.<br><br>- What you got there?<br><br>- Just something my mom needs.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>This old place, huh?<br><br>Time was, not a day<br>went by when someone<br><br>wasn't stopping by the<br>office to ask me about it.<br><br>- Yeah, I just have to research<br>that for a book report.<br><br>- Why didn't you just<br>ask your mom about it?<br><br>- She's been a little...<br><br>- Right, out of sorts.<br><br>I was sorry to hear about<br>the trouble at home.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>I might have some<br>answers for you.<br><br>This house, it's been a god<br>damn tough sell for 50 years.<br><br>Never had much luck<br>with it myself.<br><br>But your mom nearly did once,<br><br>until the buyers found out.<br><br>- Found out what?<br><br>- To understand that,<br><br>you'd have to understand<br>who lived there.<br><br>- Who lived there?<br><br>- Miss Natty Nocks.<br><br>- Natty Nocks?<br><br>Like Natty Knocks nine times?<br><br>I thought that was just<br>an old ghost story.<br><br>- Why, where do you think<br>those stories come from?<br><br>There's always a<br>little truth to 'em.<br><br>Nocks family around here, hell,<br><br>go all the way<br>back to the 1800s.<br><br>Hard scrabble German folk.<br><br>And Natty Nocks, now,<br>she was the only child<br><br>of a God fearing<br>German farm couple.<br><br>One day, they<br>discovered her upstairs<br><br>in the family home<br>in bed with a boy<br><br>and those good Christian<br>church going parents of hers,<br><br>they tossed her<br>out on the street.<br><br>- That's harsh.<br><br>- Anyway, she took off for LA,<br><br>hopes of becoming a movie star.<br><br>And the funny thing is...<br><br>The funny thin is,<br>Wyatt, she almost was.<br><br>You see, Natty Nocks,<br>she starred in those<br>drive-in movies,<br><br>B pictures, double<br>bill horror flicks,<br><br>one right after the<br>other back in the 60s.<br><br>Yeah, she was pretty.<br><br>Not much of an actress.<br><br>And when her looks gave out,<br>well, the movies stopped.<br><br>She wound up back here<br>with a young child.<br><br>The old Nocks place had been<br>abandoned by her family.<br><br>They just kind of moved in.<br><br>No one around this town had<br>anything to do with her,<br><br>or the boy.<br><br>And desperate to make<br>ends meet, Natty...<br><br>Well, Natty became<br>a, how do I put this?<br><br>A good time for the men in town<br><br>who wanted to live<br>out their fantasies<br><br>of being with a movie star.<br><br>Of course, the wives in town<br><br>did not appreciate Ms. Natty's<br>local one woman brothel<br><br>or the little black<br>book that she kept<br><br>all their husband's names in.<br><br>Because of the kind of parts<br>she played down in Hollywood,<br><br>the women had somehow<br>convinced themselves<br><br>that she was some kind of<br>a hippie witch and a whore.<br><br>They tried to run<br>her out of town.<br><br>Oh, Natty was<br>having none of that.<br><br>No, sir.<br><br>She refused and just<br>kept her business busy,<br><br>busy, busy, busy,<br><br>busy writing down the names<br>of all those husbands.<br><br>And when she wouldn't tell 'em<br><br>where she hid her<br>little black book,<br><br>they lit a tool shed<br>behind her house on fire,<br><br>Natty locked inside.<br><br>A coroner called it<br>death by misadventure.<br><br>An accident, could have<br>happened to anybody.<br><br>Shouldn't store gasoline<br>in a toolshed, they said.<br><br>Blah, blah, blah.<br><br>But people know better.<br><br>I knew better.<br><br>A town knows its secrets, Wyatt.<br><br>A town knows how to hide 'em.<br><br>- What happened to the boy?<br><br>- Nate?<br><br>Nate was institutionalized.<br><br>They fried his brain<br>with shock therapy<br><br>to keep him quiet about<br>what he might know,<br><br>what he might have seen.<br><br>- Shock therapy?<br><br>- He died up in Butler<br>psych ward around 2008.<br><br>- Is he really dead?<br><br>- See for yourself, Wyatt.<br><br>They got him buried in a<br>cheap box up in Oak Hill.<br><br>- Who's there?<br><br>- Are you speeding.<br><br>- In this?<br><br>- What's going on?<br><br>- It's cops.<br><br>- Is this about the copper?<br><br>- Shut up<br><br>- Is something wrong, officer?<br><br>- Taillights busted and<br>your tags are expired.<br><br>License and<br>registration, please.<br><br>- Come on, really?<br><br>- Officer, this is<br>my fault, really.<br><br>- I got a flat tire on my<br>bike and I needed a ride home.<br><br>- And where are you<br>going this time of night?<br><br>- I was at my mom's<br>office in town.<br><br>I was picking something up for<br>her and it got late and dark<br><br>and I needed a ride.<br><br>We've been having a<br>real hard time at home<br><br>and Britt's been helping us out.<br><br>- You Diane Hemming's boy?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- I was up at your<br>house not long ago.<br><br>- Yeah, sorry about that.<br><br>- Look, I don't wanna see<br>this rig back on the road<br><br>until the tags are clean<br>and the lights are working.<br><br>You understand?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>Thank you, officer.<br><br>- Now y'all go straight home.<br><br>And you, young lady,<br>it's past your bedtime.<br><br>- Are you okay, Jolie?<br><br>- No, I'm not okay!<br><br>Wyatt's phone got turned<br>off and we needed money,<br><br>so we ditched.<br><br>Then we stole copper wire<br>from the Baldwin house.<br><br>Then they saw a man<br>beating up a girl.<br><br>She might be dead but<br>nobody can find her<br><br>because the cops<br>didn't do anything!<br><br>Dad's never coming home again.<br><br>- What?<br><br>Wyatt, what is<br>she talking about?<br><br>Is any of this true?<br><br>- All of it.<br><br>All of it's true.<br><br>- We are going home right now.<br><br>- I'm sorry.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>You can't be here.<br><br>- I belong here.<br><br>- Nobody belongs here,<br>not in her house.<br><br>Not in her house!<br><br>Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>Do I know you?<br><br>- You know who I am.<br><br>- No, you can't be Nate.<br><br>No, no, no.<br><br>You stay back, now.<br><br>You stay back.<br><br>You stay back, now!<br><br>- You didn't try to help her.<br><br>- Why are you hassling me?<br><br>I don't know shit<br>about no stolen copper.<br><br>- I got a report of a black<br>Toyota seen in the area.<br><br>You know who drives<br>a black Toyota?<br><br>You, tough guy.<br><br>- Me and a million<br>fucking other people.<br><br>Get out of here with that crap.<br><br>- I've got a witness who<br>says they saw a black Toyota<br><br>near the high school.<br><br>You wanna talk about that?<br><br>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Don't you lay that girl on me.<br><br>I got a cleanup job<br>over there, okay?<br><br>Do your fucking job<br>and check it out.<br><br>- You better believe I will.<br><br>- Am I done here?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>You'll be back.<br><br>- Hey Ken, I need you to<br>run a set of prints for me.<br><br>- I can't run<br>unauthorized prints.<br><br>You know that.<br><br>- Look, it's the last time.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Oh, third base line,<br>lower level, row 12.<br><br>Dodgers, Giants.<br><br>- Fine.<br><br>I can maybe have<br>these by tonight.<br><br>- I need it sooner.<br><br>- They catalog every search.<br><br>I have to be careful.<br><br>- All right.<br><br>You have my cell phone.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>- Hi, can you help me?<br><br>The front desk said that I<br>was supposed to go back here,<br><br>but I don't think I'm<br>in the right place.<br><br>- The right place for what?<br><br>- I have information<br>about a murder.<br><br>- A murder?<br><br>- The missing girl<br>from the television.<br><br>- Come with me, please.<br><br>This way.<br><br>Don't worry about the lights.<br><br>They're fixing the place up.<br><br>- Is this the right way?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Excuse me.<br><br>Are you Britt Chamberland?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Detective Squares.<br><br>The desk sergeant said you<br>might have some information.<br><br>- Oh, he was taking<br>me to see you.<br><br>- Okay, well, he's<br>taking you the wrong way.<br><br>Why don't she come with me?<br><br>I'll buy you a Coke and<br>you can tell me your story.<br><br>This way.<br><br>Brains before bears, Abner.<br><br>What the hell's<br>your problem, man?<br><br>So the game is<br>called Natty Knocks.<br><br>- That's right.<br><br>- I've got kids, but<br>refresh my memory.<br><br>- You run up to somebody's<br>door and you knock<br><br>and you run away<br>before they answer.<br><br>- Nine times.<br><br>But my friend didn't run away.<br><br>He looked through the window<br><br>and he saw this creepy<br>guy beating up a girl.<br><br>He thinks it's the same<br>girl on the missing posters.<br><br>Well, we got a big problem<br><br>with domestic violence.<br><br>I mean, is it possible he<br>saw a husband and wife thing<br><br>maybe get out of control?<br><br>- No.<br><br>No, he's sure that the man<br>was trying to kill her.<br><br>- And your friend called 9-1-1?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- So there's a record of the<br>call in the dispatch order.<br><br>- I suppose.<br><br>- And you say this<br>happened yesterday?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- So why don't you<br>think the officers<br><br>made an arrest at the scene?<br><br>I mean, what it sounds like,<br>she put a hell of a fight.<br><br>There would be broken furniture.<br><br>This guy would have<br>trauma on his face.<br><br>And yet this man didn't<br>leave in handcuffs.<br><br>- Yeah, that's why I'm here.<br><br>- But not your friend.<br><br>- Yeah, well, he's scared,<br><br>but he wants to do<br>the right thing.<br><br>Look, if there's a chance<br>that this girl can be found,<br><br>maybe she's still alive.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>- The only thing I<br>got from yesterday<br><br>is a call about some<br>stolen copper wire.<br><br>- Well, I'm...<br><br>I'm just...<br><br>I'm thinking about<br>the missing girl.<br><br>She's in my school.<br><br>- Well, listen, we're gonna<br>look into all of this.<br><br>In the meantime,<br><br>I just want you to stay<br>kind of close to home.<br><br>Be safe and I'll call<br>you if anything comes up.<br><br>And there's my number, so.<br><br>- Hi, Lori.<br><br>Is Mr. Meredith in?<br><br>- I haven't seen him yet today.<br><br>He did leave something<br>on your desk, though.<br><br>- Do you know what it is?<br><br>- I think it was something<br>about the old Nocks House.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>You might wanna talk<br>to Wyatt about this.<br><br>What are you up to, kid?<br><br>- Guys?<br><br>Guys?<br><br>- How'd it go?<br><br>- I talked to a detective<br>and I told him everything.<br><br>They're gonna be<br>all over that guy.<br><br>- What about the copper wire?<br><br>- I covered it up for you.<br><br>Don't do anything stupid<br>like that again, okay?<br><br>- Is it over?<br><br>- Yeah, everything's<br>gonna be just fine.<br><br>- Did that cop know who we are?<br><br>- No, I didn't<br>tell him your name.<br><br>I just said it was a friend.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Can you stop being such a<br>pain in my ass all the time now?<br><br>You know, I'm only<br>trying to help you.<br><br>- Yeah, I'm sorry.<br><br>- Accepted.<br><br>Now, your mom is<br>working late tonight<br><br>and I think we need<br>to have a little fun.<br><br>- I wanna go to the ghost<br>house and wear my mask<br><br>and reach into the guts<br>and pull out prizes!<br><br>- You coming?<br><br>- I should tell<br>Robby that it's over.<br><br>- He's the one that got<br>you into this trouble<br><br>in the first place.<br><br>You know that, right?<br><br>- I owe him.<br><br>- No, you don't owe<br>him a fucking thing!<br><br>- Uh, excuse me.<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>- I'm so sorry, you scared me.<br><br>- Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>I didn't mean to, I<br>thought you were a prowler.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>That time of year, huh?<br><br>- Yeah, every kid in town.<br><br>- No, I'm Diane with<br>Hemmings Realty.<br><br>I'm sure you've seen our signs.<br><br>- Of course.<br><br>- Well, we used to<br>have this listing<br><br>and then now the bank has it.<br><br>And I think there might<br>be someone squatting here,<br><br>so I wanted to just<br>go check it out.<br><br>- Well, I think I saw<br>the back door open.<br><br>Let's go take a look.<br><br>- Oh, okay.<br><br>Looks like somebody<br>tried to break in.<br><br>It was probably kids.<br><br>I have two of my own.<br><br>Should get rid of<br>all of this junk.<br><br>- That must mean<br>something to someone.<br><br>- Somebody without taste.<br><br>- Somebody may be<br>coming back for these.<br><br>- Doubtful.<br><br>Everybody thinks this<br>place is haunted.<br><br>- Do you believe in ghosts?<br><br>- Me, no.<br><br>No, I believe people<br>are bad enough.<br><br>They don't have to invent<br>things to be afraid of.<br><br>- Should we look<br>in the basement?<br><br>- No.<br><br>I think I'm good.<br><br>I've seen enough.<br><br>But thank you for your help.<br><br>If you are ever on the<br>market for a house...<br><br>- I know, I know.<br><br>A house is not a house<br>unless it's a Hemmings house.<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>- That's right.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- What is that?<br><br>- I don't know.<br><br>No idea.<br><br>- What the hell<br>is going on here?<br><br>- Say choke me.<br><br>- No.<br><br>- Say it!<br><br>- No!<br><br>- Louder!<br><br>- Choke me.<br><br>- Louder.<br><br>Louder!<br><br>- Choke me!<br><br>- Do as you're told.<br><br>- Robby, what the<br>hell is happening?<br><br>- I thought that if<br>I could get his name,<br><br>I could turn it into the<br>police and get the 5,000 bucks.<br><br>And me and my mom can get out<br>of this shitty town for good.<br><br>- What are you talking about?<br><br>- There's a reason why the<br>cops didn't do anything, Wyatt.<br><br>- What are you saying?<br><br>- He's a cop.<br><br>- What?<br><br>- Yeah, his name<br>is Abner Honeywell.<br><br>- How do you know that?<br><br>- I checked his driver's license<br><br>and I saw his fucking<br>uniform, dude.<br><br>- You went back there?<br><br>Are you insane?<br><br>- I had to!<br><br>- Tell me you didn't.<br><br>- I threw that through<br>the fucking window.<br><br>But I forgot you're a psycho<br><br>and put your initials<br>on everything!<br><br>- What were you thinking?<br><br>- I thought that maybe if<br>he knew we saw what he did,<br><br>he would get scared and then<br>turn himself into the police<br><br>and then I could<br>collect the money.<br><br>- Dude, Britt went to<br>the police station today<br><br>and she talked to a cop.<br><br>- What?<br><br>- Yeah, she told him<br>everything we saw.<br><br>- What did he look like?<br><br>What was his name?<br><br>- I don't fucking know, Robby.<br><br>- Money.<br><br>- Yeah, it's a<br>little late for that.<br><br>Dude, we have to find Britt.<br><br>- Remember the rules.<br><br>- Don't move and<br>don't touch anything.<br><br>- And don't scare<br>your babysitter.<br><br>- Okay.<br><br>This is awesome, right Britt?<br><br>- If you say so.<br><br>- Did you just pee?<br><br>- No.<br><br>- I think I did.<br><br>- I told you not to<br>scare your babysitter.<br><br>- Abner, what the fuck<br>are you doing here?<br><br>- I'm working.<br><br>- Working.<br><br>Where's your duty belt?<br><br>- Have you been following me?<br><br>- I've been following<br>her and I'm glad I did.<br><br>You know, a pair of uni's<br>talked to you recently,<br><br>but you're good old Abner,<br>three weeks from retirement.<br><br>Everybody loves you.<br><br>Well, I never bought it.<br><br>I never bought you.<br><br>Right, don't pull that<br>Halloween shit with me.<br><br>- She took Jolie to<br>the Baldwin house!<br><br>- Whoa.<br><br>Britt, look how<br>cool this room is.<br><br>Whoa, that almost looks real.<br><br>Britt, look.<br><br>Britt?<br><br>Britt, look.<br><br>Britt!<br><br>Britt!<br><br>Britt?<br><br>Britt?<br><br>- Jolie?<br><br>Jolie?<br><br>Jolie!<br><br>- Britt, where are you?<br><br>- Wyatt!<br><br>- What, what's happening?<br><br>- I got lost in<br>that stupid house<br><br>and then I walked through<br>the wrong door and...<br><br>We're never going in<br>that stupid place again.<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>- He came with me.<br><br>- And you should know better!<br><br>After everything<br>that's happened,<br><br>Robby, don't you think<br>you've done enough?<br><br>- What was the name of the<br>cop that you talked to?<br><br>- I didn't tell him<br>about any stolen copper.<br><br>- What was the name of the cop?<br><br>Was it Honeywell?<br><br>- No, it was Detective Squares.<br><br>Happy?<br><br>We're going.<br><br>You too, Wyatt.<br><br>Let's go, say goodnight.<br><br>Stay here or go wherever,<br><br>but you're not coming with us.<br><br>- I'm trying to help you.<br><br>- Next time, treat<br>your friends better.<br><br>- Fine.<br><br>Go, see if I care!<br><br>- Did you get in?<br><br>- I've had it for two days.<br><br>I'm afraid to open it.<br><br>- What are you waiting for?<br><br>- The minute I open<br>this, everything changes.<br><br>Who I am, where I'm<br>going, who I'm with.<br><br>- Rick's a tool.<br><br>You know that, right?<br><br>- Yeah, but he's a cute tool.<br><br>- Look, I've never told<br>anyone this before,<br><br>but I can't wait<br>to get out of here.<br><br>Maybe if I'm lucky,<br><br>I'll nab a baseball<br>scholarship somewhere.<br><br>But that's the only<br>chance I've got.<br><br>This is yours.<br><br>Don't blow it.<br><br>Well?<br><br>- Holy shit.<br><br>I got in!<br><br>- Wow.<br><br>Is that Rick?<br><br>- Yeah, he wants to see me.<br><br>I think I have to tell him.<br><br>- You probably should.<br><br>- Is it cool if he comes over?<br><br>- I mean, I knew you first.<br><br>- Yeah, since you<br>were like seven.<br><br>Hey, we're gonna be up<br>late, like late, late.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>I'll be in mom's office<br>and work with her computer<br><br>while you guys talk<br>and do whatever.<br><br>- Thanks, Wyatt.<br><br>Hey, you're a cool kid.<br><br>You know that, right?<br><br>And your slider is<br>your best pitch.<br><br>- Babe, we're burning<br>the witch tonight.<br><br>- Hey, I have some good news.<br><br>Why don't you come over?<br><br>Jolie's asleep and<br>I wanna see you.<br><br>- Just come over here.<br><br>- I can't, Mrs. Henderson's<br>working something out<br><br>with her ex and I have to stay.<br><br>But it's all good,<br>just come over.<br><br>- Maybe we can have<br>like a party of our own?<br><br>- Maybe.<br><br>- I'm on the way.<br><br>- Don't answer it.<br><br>Don't fucking answer it.<br><br>- Alright, keep your pants on.<br>- Don't answer it!<br><br>- You scared me.<br><br>- I'm looking for<br>Robby de La Marco.<br><br>- What did he do now?<br><br>- I need to ask him<br>a few questions.<br><br>- You have a warrant?<br><br>- Do I need one?<br><br>- If you want to<br>get in my house.<br><br>- He broke the law.<br><br>- Prove it.<br><br>Run, Robby, run!<br><br>Run!<br><br>You broke my wrist.<br><br>- Where is he?<br><br>- I'm gonna sue<br>you for millions.<br><br>Fuck you!<br><br>What kind of<br>fucking cop are you?<br><br>- I'm a bad cop.<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>- Okay, he hangs out with<br>this kid Wyatt Hemmings<br><br>on Edgewood Road.<br><br>- You're supposed to be asleep.<br><br>- I'm kind of scared.<br><br>- It's okay, close your eyes.<br><br>I'm right across the hall.<br><br>- Britt.<br>- Yeah?<br><br>- Why are there bad people?<br><br>Why did God make bad people?<br><br>- No one really knows.<br><br>That's the truth.<br><br>Sometimes it's a traumatic<br>event that makes them bad<br><br>or just bad blood,<br>like they're born bad.<br><br>- But why?<br><br>Why does God make mistakes?<br><br>- I can't really tell you that.<br><br>But I do know that<br>all that matters<br><br>is that your mom loves<br>you and Wyatt loves you.<br><br>And I love you,<br>and even your dad.<br><br>Most people are good.<br><br>Can you say that?<br><br>- Most people are good.<br><br>- Right, now go to sleep.<br><br>We'll do something fun tomorrow.<br><br>- Britt.<br><br>- Yeah?<br><br>- I love you.<br><br>- I know, I love you too.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>- Oh my God.<br><br>Abner Honeywell is Nate Nocks.<br><br>- College grad of the future?<br><br>Or the Avocado<br>queen of Fillmore.<br><br>I guess we're gonna find out.<br><br>Just don't wake her up.<br><br>Wait in the bedroom.<br><br>I have something for you.<br><br>It's freezing in here.<br><br>Over here, lover boy.<br><br>- Where are they?<br><br>Where are they?<br><br>- With their dad.<br><br>- If you are lying to me...<br><br>- I'm not.<br><br>He took them.<br><br>- Call 9-1-1.<br><br>- Don't go down there.<br><br>- I have to.<br><br>- Don't leave me.<br><br>- What?<br><br>- They fucking left.<br><br>He's got Britt!<br><br>- Let's fucking go!<br><br>- He's taking her home!<br><br>- What?<br><br>- To his mother's house.<br><br>- You ready to do this?<br><br>- Yeah, he'll kill her.<br><br>- Hey, let's just hope you<br>swing better than you can throw.<br><br>- Let's get this shit, bro.<br><br>I'll get the front and<br>you go in the back, okay?<br><br>- Good luck, man.<br><br>- Knock, knock!<br><br>I know who you are.<br><br>You're Nate Nocks.<br><br>Do you hear me, motherfucker?<br><br>Nate Nocks.<br><br>- What the<br>fuck are you doing?<br><br>- I came to help you.<br><br>- Jesus, dude,<br>I thought you were dead.<br><br>- It'll take a lot<br>more than that.<br><br>- Hey, thanks for<br>saving my ass back there.<br><br>- Can't have your mom leave me.<br><br>- Dude, you're a<br>real piece of work.<br><br>Hey, let's go get<br>this piece of shit.<br><br>- I'll fucking kill him.<br><br>- Dude, calm down.<br><br>- What the fuck?<br><br>- He's with me.<br><br>- What the hell did you<br>guys do to piss of this man?<br><br>- He's a psycho cop and no<br>one's gonna stop him but us.<br><br>- So what's the plan?<br><br>- I'll go upstairs and you<br>guys go up back to the shed.<br><br>If you see him or Britt, scream.<br><br>- Don't worry, it<br>won't be a problem.<br><br>- Let's go.<br><br>- They locked you in a nuthouse!<br><br>And then you started that fire<br>and killed all those people!<br><br>Abner Honeywell died, not you.<br><br>Where the fuck are you?<br><br>They dragged you out,<br><br>all burnt up and<br>covered in dirt.<br><br>You made them think you were<br>Abner, but it was just you,<br><br>just you little Nate Knox.<br><br>You waited.<br><br>You waited until<br>people stopped talking<br><br>or caring about some<br>creepy old story.<br><br>And then you came back home<br><br>as a new man named<br>Abner Honeywell.<br><br>You've been very busy.<br><br>This ends tonight, fucker!<br><br>Where are you?<br><br>- Wherever you want me to be.<br><br>Momma's boy.<br><br>- Please don't hurt me, please.<br><br>- Oh shit, is that her?<br><br>- Oh my God, yeah, yeah.<br><br>- Grace!<br><br>Everybody has been<br>looking for you!<br><br>- Get off of me!<br><br>Let me go!<br><br>- Watch the movie.<br><br>Watch it!<br><br>- No!<br><br>- Watch the movie.<br><br>- Let me go.<br><br>- That's right.<br><br>That's right.<br><br>- Look at it.<br><br>- What kind of<br>conditioner do you use?<br><br>- Fuck you!<br><br>- Britt!<br><br>Britt!<br><br>I know what they did to you!<br><br>- You know nothing!<br><br>Do you know what it's<br>like to have a mother<br><br>living inside you,<br>rooting and nesting?<br><br>She's a prisoner of all her<br>movies and she is hungry.<br><br>Well, mommy asked me to feed<br>her and she said if I did,<br><br>she'd let me go.<br><br>So don't blame me.<br><br>She's the whore!<br><br>- Go get her up,<br>get her upstairs!<br><br>- Stop right there!<br><br>Don't move.<br><br>Don't fucking move!<br><br>- Damn you all to hell!<br><br>- Holy shsit.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>- Go, go, go!<br><br>- Come on, we've got you.<br><br>Okay, easy.<br><br>- Wyatt,<br><br>- I'm coming, mom.<br><br>I'm coming.<br><br>- What the fuck was that?<br><br>-

headed<br>back.<br><br>- Mommy!<br><br>- Oh, honey.<br><br>- Are you okay?<br><br>- I love you so much.<br><br>- We're okay.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>- You're some kind of hero, kid.<br><br>- Not so bad yourself.<br><br>- How much is the<br>reward, by the way?<br><br>I'll tell your mom you're okay.<br><br>What's up, bro?<br><br>- What's going on?<br><br>- You all right?<br><br>- Not really.<br><br>-

	<h1>Our Wife (1941) - full transcript</h1>
			<p class="plot">Jerry Marvin, a talented musician and composer, wallows in drunken self-pity after he is divorced by his wife Babe. Along comes new love Susan, who rescues Jerry and provides him with fresh inspiration to complete his trumpet concerto. He performs it, it's a hit, and the jubilant Jerry and Susan plan to marry. There's just one hitch: Now Babe wants him back... and the unscrupulous ex-wife will stop at nothing to recapture her man.</p>

Dad's a scientist, so are<br>all his friends, so, when I was little,<br><br>they thought it would be amusing<br>to make a scientist out of a girl.<br><br>- United States citizen?<br>- Yes.<br><br>- How long are you going to be in New York?<br>- Oh, just for the summer.<br><br>We have to be back in California<br>for the fall semester.<br><br>- Where are you going to stay?<br>- I don't know, at a hotel, I suppose.<br><br>Well, look, I've got a house<br>in Pelham Manor on the bay.<br><br>Not very far from town, nobody's using it.<br>Why don't you use it?<br><br>It's pretty hot in New York in the<br>summer and a house is always cool.<br><br>Oh, thank you very much,<br>I... I don't...<br><br>It's purely selfish of my part.<br><br>I'll charge you rent against<br>those IOUs of mine.<br><br>Oh, but it's got a boat landing and...<br><br>...a little beach with the best<br>silver sand outside of a bird cage.<br><br>Yes, but supposing you wanted<br>to go back to New York?<br><br>Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.<br>Cristobal's more my size.<br><br>Yes, the liquor's much cheaper there too.<br><br>I hadn't thought of that,<br>but now that you've mentioned it,<br><br>it presents very interesting<br>possibilities.<br><br>Why do you drink so much?<br><br>Oh, I don't know.<br><br>Things get pretty gray sometimes.<br><br>I tried brightening them up by keeping<br>a lamp lit in the window.<br><br>It didn't help much.<br><br>From keeping a lamp lit to keeping<br>myself lit was a natural step.<br><br>Tom tells me you're quite a composer.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, all the world is wating<br>for my unwritten compositions.<br><br>Well, you think you should give up trying<br>just because you and some lady...<br><br>...had amatory difficulties?<br><br>- Landing permits, please.<br>- Oh, yes.<br><br>Se?or Marvin!

Thank you.<br><br>Oh, and, uh...<br><br>Don't forget to turn out the...<br><br>...pilot light under the hot water<br>heater before you go to bed.<br><br>- It has a nasty habit of blowing out.<br>- Pilot light? What on earth...<br><br>- And, uh...<br>- Se?or, please!<br><br>Okay, okay.<br><br>The short-wave knob's gone<br>off the radio.<br><br>You'll find it in the top drawer<br>of the bureau in the living room.<br><br>Bye.<br><br>- Bye.<br>- Bye.<br><br>- Bye.<br>- Bye, Jerry.<br><br>Hey, the key!<br><br>You can't get in without the key.<br><br>Key?

I have no right<br>to deprive the world of my music.<br><br>That's very generous of you, my boy,<br>very generous.<br><br>I played some of my stuff for<br>Beckhart, the conductor.<br><br>He thinks it's swell, thinks I can write<br>a modern symphony.<br><br>Says if I can and he likes it,<br>he'll produce it.<br><br>And he's gotta like it.<br><br>- And you people have to help me.<br>- Just how can we help?<br><br>By staying here and keeping on<br>meddling in my business.<br><br>Susan, you started this,<br>it's your decision.<br><br>Well, will you help Tom upstairs with<br>the bags upstairs? They're out in the hall.<br><br>Yes, ma'am!<br>Right away, ma'am!<br><br>If y'all wants anything, ma'am,<br>don't forget to ring, ma'am.<br><br>Right this way, ma'am, right this way.<br><br>Susan, how long have you known me?<br><br>Nigh on all my life, I guess.<br><br>I've always taught you to make<br>your own decisions, haven't I?<br><br>That's right.<br><br>I'm beginning to wonder if I was right.<br><br>Why, Dad?<br><br>I'm only thinking of your happiness,<br>my dear.<br><br>Hey, you Drakes, come on up<br>and see your rooms.<br><br>We're coming, Jerry.<br><br>Step right up, folks, the tour<br>of the house begins immediately.<br><br>This is the only house in Westchester County<br>in which George Washington did not sleep.<br><br>It was built in 1752 by a farmer<br>named Phineas Culpepper.<br><br>- Phineas did alright for himself.<br>- He certainly did.<br><br>Yonder is the master's bedroom,<br><br>that one's for Tom and the professor,<br><br>- and this is Mama's room.<br>- Mama's room?<br><br>Hm-hmm, my mother was<br>the first one to sleep in here.<br><br>It's the best room in the house, ma'am.<br><br>The bathroom's over there.<br><br>Hot and cold water running all the time.<br>There's a big closet over here.<br><br>And if you should want anything, ma'am,<br>please press the buzzer right next to the bed.<br><br>The management would like to feel<br>that you're quite comfortable.<br><br>Oh, and by the way, there's<br>a laboratory downstairs...<br><br>...that you can use for your experiments.<br><br>Laboratory?<br><br>Yes, ma'am, it's a little room<br>adjoining the study...<br><br>...that I use for dabbling at<br>photography sometimes.<br><br>- You think of everything.<br>- We aim to please, ma'am.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Uh, if you won't make any complaints<br>to the management, ma'am,<br><br>there's something I'd like to tell you.<br><br>But I never make any complaints,<br>ask the bellboys up and down the West Coast.<br><br>Well, perhaps I'd better not<br>tell you now.<br><br>Not yet. Maybe after the concert.<br><br>Thank you, ma'am.<br><br>Oh, you won't need a key, ma'am,<br>this man-eating monster will protect you.<br><br>Did my father...<br><br>Is there a ticket left for me...<br>the name is Drake, Miss Susan Drake?<br><br>- Yes, ma'am.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Sorry, but you'll have to wait<br>till the number's over.<br><br>- Oh, please.<br>- Sorry.<br><br>But I won't make a disturbance,<br>I'll be very quiet.<br><br>That's my orders.<br><br>But I'm a very good friend<br>of Mr. Marvin's.<br><br>I'm sorry, ma'am.<br><br>- Could I just listen here?<br>- Sure, lady.<br><br>- He's pretty good, isn't he?<br>- Pretty good?<br><br>- You really think so?<br>- Don't you?<br><br>Oh, I think he's wonderful.<br><br>Say, I've been on this door a great many<br>years and I know a hit when I hear one.<br><br>This guy is a hit.<br><br>Sorry, ma'am, you'll have to wait<br>till this number's over.<br><br>Well, there's nothing on this ticket<br>that forces me...<br><br>...to stay out here until the<br>number's over.<br><br>- Sorry, ma'am, orders.<br>- I'm Mrs. Jerome Marvin,<br><br>the composer's wife.<br><br>If my own wife came late,<br>I couldn't let her in.<br><br>My wife's bigger and stronger than I am,<br>she ain't bashful about letting me know it.<br><br>I don't get around to these concerts much.<br>What do you do in a case like this?<br><br>You just wait.<br><br>Seems to me a wife should be able to listen<br>to her own husband blow his horn.<br><br>Well, don't look at me, lady.<br><br>After the revolution and I own<br>this joint, I'll let you in.<br><br>- Cigarette?<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Used to burn me to have<br>my performances interrupted.<br><br>I can understand that.<br><br>Neither had they ever taught me<br>to come on time for anybody else's.<br><br>You're not a professional yourself?<br><br>Well, in a sense, yes.<br><br>But my performances aren't very intriguing,<br>consequently I have very little audience.<br><br>That's too bad.<br>Wait till you get up in the big time.<br><br>- Big time?<br>- The tops, honey.<br><br>Don't you be discouraged,<br>just keep at it.<br><br>You look like you got plenty<br>on the ball.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Do you mind?<br><br>Say, that husband of mine's<br>doing pretty good.<br><br>Pretty good?<br><br>Doing alright.<br><br>I always knew he had it in him.<br><br>Who was it said, to know a man<br>you've got to live with him?<br><br>Was it Pickwick?<br><br>Oh, I've got to tell that to Jerry,<br>he's got a great sense of humor.<br><br>Most men have, once in a while.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>He tears civilized veneer<br>right off music.<br><br>He's mixed Americana with African<br>so well you can't tell.<br><br>So savage, it was wonderful,<br>don't you think?<br><br>Susan, where have you been?<br>Anything wrong?<br><br>No, no, nothing. Dr. Hogarth<br>detained me...<br><br>...and the doorman wouldn't let<br>me in until intermission.<br><br>That's too bad. Jerry's doing<br>himself proud.<br><br>Wasn't he wonderful, I had no idea a man<br>could get such music out of a trumpet.<br><br>We'll have to go backstage<br>and congratulate him.<br><br>- No, no, I'd rather not.<br>- Why not?<br><br>- Let's take our seats.<br>- Susan, it's the right thing to do.<br><br>Who sharpened his pencils<br>when they were dull? I did.<br><br>And who lay awake night after night<br>listening to him toot that horn?<br><br>I did.<br><br>And now it's a night for us to howl<br>and what happens?<br><br>I'm rushed off to bed.<br><br>Aren't you all in bed?<br><br>I've given up all hope for<br>the two of you.<br><br>When you can refuse to go backstage<br>even to congratulate a friend...<br><br>on the night of his greatest triumph,<br>you're still intellectual snobs. You...<br><br>- What's wrong with you two?<br>- Oh, go to bed, Tom.<br><br>Not until after Jerry gets here.<br><br>I sometimes think there must have been a<br>mix-up at the hospital when you were born...<br><br>...and we got the wrong brat.<br><br>That still doesn't explain<br>what brought this on.<br><br>What brought what on?<br><br>This frost, this dry ice,<br>this sub-zero cold wave.<br><br>What the devil are you talking about?<br><br>Never mind, I just killed myself.<br><br>I'm dead, I never asked a question,<br>it was all a myth.<br><br>Susan, you'll always be my<br>favorite daughter.<br><br>Good night, Dad.<br><br>I'm going to wait up a little while<br>see if comes.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- Tom.<br>- Hm?<br><br>Jerry's ex-wife was at the<br>music hall tonight.<br><br>Oh, she was. Well, I bet she went<br>backstage to see Jerry.<br><br>That's why Susan didn't go.<br>She was afraid she might be intruding...<br><br>...since the divorce is not final yet.<br><br>Well, I still can't underst...<br><br>You... you mean Susan and Jerry?<br><br>Go ahead, Dad, and don't put<br>any sentiment into it.<br><br>Very tempting.<br><br>I beg your pardon. Mr. Marvin still<br>lives here, doesn't he?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Well, I'm Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>- May I come in and wait for him?<br>- Of course.<br><br>You do expect him. I missed him<br>at the music hall and...<br><br>Of, course, I knew I'd seen you before.<br><br>You're the girl in the lobby.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Imagine us meeting that way.<br><br>I mean, both of us sort of<br>in the same boat.<br><br>- Late for the concert.<br>- Yes, it was odd.<br><br>My woman's intuition certainly<br>wasn't working tonight.<br><br>Well, there are two schools of thought<br>on woman's intuition.<br><br>Is that so?<br><br>You're clever, aren't you?<br><br>But that's to be expected.<br><br>Jerry always liked brains around him.<br><br>Well, everything looks just the same.<br><br>- Oh, we haven't changed anything.<br>- Been staying here long?<br><br>- Since June.<br>- Six weeks.<br><br>Doesn't it bore you?<br><br>I mean, being way out here<br>so far from town.<br><br>Well, we like it any place just<br>so long as we can be together.<br><br>How very cozy.<br><br>Susan.<br><br>Oh, this is Tom, he lives here<br>as does my father.<br><br>Tom, this is Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Well... well, so you're Mrs. Marvin, I...<br><br>- We expect Jerry any minute now.<br>- Well, don't.<br><br>- Why? He is coming home.<br>- Oh, yes, but not right away.<br><br>You see, I know Jerry.<br><br>There's nothing like being married<br>to a man to find out about him.<br><br>Right now he's at Reuben's.<br><br>Every time he's had a successful opening<br>he always goes to Reuben's first.<br><br>The boys and the sturgeon sandwich.<br><br>Then it's Lindy's. The boys<br>and the chicken liver sandwich.<br><br>It's been going on for years.<br><br>Look here, there's no sense in your losing<br>any sleep on my account.<br><br>You don't have to wait up with me.<br><br>- We don't mind.<br>- No, it's a pleasure.<br><br>Oh, please, run along to bed.<br>I don't mind waiting up for him.<br><br>After all, it isn't as though I were<br>a stranger in a strange house.<br><br>Well, if you'll excuse us, good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Hello, I...<br><br>Hello, darling.<br><br>Well, well, well.<br><br>I'm sorry I haven't a fatted<br>calf to kill.<br><br>I don't think that's amusing, darling.<br><br>Babe, why did you come back?<br><br>For a very ordinary reason.<br><br>- I love you, I want to be your wife.<br>- All of this so sudden.<br><br>You know, Jerry, I was very young<br>when you married me.<br><br>- I wasn't exactly Methuselah myself.<br>- You were my first love.<br><br>Yeah, I suppose you had to make<br>a start somewhere.<br><br>A girl who's known only one man<br>is inclined to go off...<br><br>...and search for something<br>she thinks she's missed.<br><br>- Oh, Babe.<br>- But I came home to you.<br><br>Oh, please, please, darling.<br><br>Put out the welcome mat in front<br>of the door for Baby.<br><br>The same old Babe.<br><br>Thinks all she has to do is crook her<br>little finger and along comes Jerry.<br><br>I was at your concert tonight.<br><br>If you feel you were cheated, I can<br>refund you the price of your ticket.<br><br>I don't know much about music,<br>were you good?<br><br>Suppose you read the reviews<br>on your way home?<br><br>And before you go, the key, please.<br><br>You know the judge gave me the house.<br><br>I've missed you, Jerry,<br>missed you like the very devil.<br><br>When did you begin to pine for me?<br><br>Right after the concert?<br><br>I'll lay odds you called<br>your attorney first...<br><br>...asking if there was any money<br>in composing music.<br><br>Would you believe me if I told you<br>that I've learned my lesson?<br><br>I love you, Jerry.<br><br>I loved you when I asked<br>for the divorce.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry I came.<br><br>I'm sorry I came to beg forgiveness<br>for hurting you.<br><br>I'm not sorry you hurt me.<br><br>Oh, darling...<br><br>No, because if you hadn't, there wouldn't<br>have been any symphony as you call it.<br><br>You were a sort of a reverse<br>inspiration.<br><br>You know, you heard my stuff tonight...<br><br>but I'll give you a mattress filled with<br>diamonds and rubis if you understood it.<br><br>I understood one thing, Jerry.<br><br>It was my man up there on that platform<br>making music for me.<br><br>In spite of you, Babe, in spite of you.<br><br>You know that place in the music<br>where it goes...<br><br>Let me explain it to you.<br><br>A man meets a woman,<br>it's not a very rare thing,<br><br>but this guy was dope enough<br>to believe it was.<br><br>That symphony is about me.<br><br>Yeah, from your laquered toe-nails<br>to your shellacked hairdo.<br><br>All the way from the marriage ceremony...<br><br>...through those diamond-studded gutters<br>to the divorce courts.<br><br>- Thanks, Jerry.<br>- No, thank you, Babe.<br><br>Because every time I get<br>a little discouraged,<br><br>...I'll just remember that you said<br>I couldn't do it.<br><br>All I was worth was leading a<br>high-hatted, long-tail dinner band.<br><br>Making music for a lot of fat-hip,<br>frustrated witches.<br><br>You said I couldn't do it,<br>Babe, and I did it.<br><br>Now I'm glad I came.<br><br>There are a lot of ways of telling<br>me you love me.<br><br>And if I remember rightly, you used<br>quite a few of them in your time.<br><br>But this is really something.<br><br>Oh, yes, Jerry, you wrote a symphony,<br>in spite of me, against me,<br><br>well, in spite of against, they aren't<br>far apart.<br><br>You had to think about me<br>a lot to do it.<br><br>It's like that old wheeze about<br>love and hate being the same.<br><br>Before I forget it, Babe, the key, please.<br><br>Quit howling like a banshee in the night,<br>Jerry, you still love me.<br><br>Wait a minute, I'll be right back.<br><br>Susan.<br><br>Oh, Jerry, you were splendid tonight,<br>I knew you would be.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Susan...<br><br>Will you come downstairs for a minute?<br><br>Please, I want to talk to you.<br><br>I want to ask you a question before<br>the customary introduction.<br><br>Yes, Jerry.<br><br>I've been thinking of this<br>for quite a while.<br><br>Susan, do you remember<br>the night we met?<br><br>Yes, I...<br><br>I asked you to stop making noises<br>on that horn so I could work.<br><br>And I heard music in your voice.<br><br>And then we quarrelled and...<br>I heard more music.<br><br>Then I thought I could go back to Cristobal,<br>but I couldn't because...<br><br>...when you left, the music went with you.<br><br>Susan, will you marry me?<br><br>Why, of course, Jerry.<br><br>My fianc?e, Miss Susan Drake.<br><br>- My wife, Miss Jerome Marvin.<br>- We've already met.<br><br>I wanted you to be the first<br>to know, Babe.<br><br>I think I approve.<br>She's very lovely.<br><br>Your approval makes<br>my happiness complete.<br><br>There's a great deal I could tell you about<br>Jerry that would make things easier for you.<br><br>But that would be taking<br>the fun about it.<br><br>May I wish you luck?<br>Very much luck.<br><br>Surprised, aren't you, Jerry?<br><br>You didn't think I could lose gracefully.<br><br>Well, I can. It hurts like the devil.<br><br>Right now there's nothing in the world<br>i want more than to be your wife.<br><br>So I'd better get out of here<br>while I'm still a lady.<br><br>Thanks, Jerry.<br><br>Do you mind if I go upstairs and get<br>some of the personal things I left behind?<br><br>- It's very little to ask.<br>- No, I don't mind, go right ahead, Babe.<br><br>I hope I said the right things,<br>you wanted me to accept you, didn't you?<br><br>That's why I asked you.<br><br>Well, she'll probably leave<br>you alone now.<br><br>Though I couldn't help feeling<br>sorry for her.<br><br>Everybody feels sorry for Babe.<br><br>You start out doing that and you wind up<br>with everybody feeling sorry for you.<br><br>Well, good night.<br><br>Susan, I've been thinking of this<br>for quite a while.<br><br>Do you remember the first<br>night we met?<br><br>Yes, I wanted you to stop<br>making noises on that h...<br><br>I said that before.<br><br>- I heard music in your voice.<br>- Wait a minute,<br><br>there's nobody's here with us now.<br><br>Will you please give me the courtesy<br>of not interrupting me?<br><br>I heard music in your voice.<br><br>We quarrelled and I heard more music.<br><br>Then I thought I could go back<br>to Cristobal, but I couldn't...<br><br>...because when you left, the music<br>all went with you.<br><br>Susan, will you marry me?<br><br>Will you?<br><br>I'll answer you the moment<br>I stop crying.<br><br>Well, I...<br><br>I think it's only fair for you to know I'm<br>a bad cook and I darn socks abominably.<br><br>I'd stop eating and go barefoot,<br>there isn't anything I wouldn't do.<br><br>- Do you love me?<br>- I'm just a little bit insane about you.<br><br>If you wouldn't have asked me,<br>I'd have asked you.<br><br>You'd never have gotten away from me.<br><br>Is that a nice way<br>for a girl to talk?<br><br>No, it isn't, you should be<br>talking that way.<br><br>Ooh...<br><br>Ooh...<br><br>Babe, are you hurt?<br><br>Oh, please... ooh...<br><br>- What happened?<br>- I... I slipped.<br><br>- Let me help you up.<br>- Oh, my back!<br><br>Something's happened.<br><br>I don't think you'd better move her<br>till we have a doctor.<br><br>Dr. Mandel, please. I want you<br>to tell me the truth.<br><br>What's the matter with me?<br><br>You're suffering from shock.<br>Oh, nothing organically wrong.<br><br>But shock can produce severe conditions.<br><br>- And in your case...<br>- It's my legs, isn't it?<br><br>Only temporarily, Babe.<br><br>Oh, gosh...<br><br>A week, a month.<br><br>A week?<br><br>A month?<br><br>I can't stay here.<br><br>Jerry, this accident is my<br>misfortune, not yours.<br><br>- Babe, please.<br>- What am I going to do?<br><br>Oh, I'm so alone. Where am I<br>going to go, Jerry?<br><br>Oh, Jerry, I know I shouldn't<br>stay here, but please.<br><br>Please don't send me away.<br><br>Let me stay here until I can<br>pull myself together.<br><br>Jerry, she'll have you for<br>the rest of your life.<br><br>Give me a little time.<br><br>Babe, Babe, you mustn't excite yourself.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>Please forget what I said.<br><br>You'll feel much better in the morning<br>after a good night's sleep.<br><br>These belong to Mrs. Marvin.<br>She dropped them on the steps.<br><br>She'll need a nurse too.<br><br>Jerry, please call Hattie.<br><br>Hattie's my maid. She's better for me<br>than any old hard-boiled nurse.<br><br>All right, I'll call her.<br>Is it okay with you, Frank?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I'll leave her these sleeping tablets.<br>Give her two of them.<br><br>Yes, doctor.<br><br>Good night, Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Good night, Babe, see you in the morning.<br><br>- Jerry.<br>- I'll make her comfortable.<br><br>I don't suppose it'll make you feel any<br>better if I told you how sorry I am.<br><br>By all the rules, I should hate you.<br><br>Well, if it will help, I wish you would.<br><br>I'll try like the devil, Susan.<br><br>- May I call you Susan?<br>- Of course.<br><br>- Is this too warm?<br>- Yes, please.<br><br>Leave that one on, please.<br><br>Is there anything else<br>you want before I go?<br><br>Please don't leave me.<br>I get the jitters lying here alone.<br><br>I start to think and begin<br>feeling sorry for myself.<br><br>And there's nothing sorrier<br>than Babe feeling sorry for herself.<br><br>Poor Jerry, he always plays that<br>way when he's upset.<br><br>- Shall I ask him to stop?<br>- On, no don't disturb him.<br><br>It doesn't bother me.<br><br>Jerry always said I was selfish<br>and I guess I am.<br><br>You're tired and sleepy and I make<br>you sit here just the same.<br><br>I don't mind.<br><br>Please go to bed, I'd feel better<br>if you did.<br><br>I'll buzz if I need anything.<br><br>Jerry's downstairs, he'll hear if I buzz.<br><br>Where's the buzzer?<br><br>There it is.<br><br>Thank you, you've been very sweet.<br><br>- Good night.<br>- Good night.<br><br>No, don't put on the light, Dad.<br><br>- Healthy animal.<br>- I wish I were more like him.<br><br>Mind if I take you as you are?<br><br>It's an awful mess, isn't it, Dad?<br><br>- It could be worse.<br>- It is.<br><br>Jerry asked me to marry him<br>and I accepted.<br><br>Hm, it is worse.<br><br>It was different before I knew her.<br><br>Even now after I met her didn't make<br>so much difference, but now...<br><br>Not very sporting competing<br>with a woman who is helpless.<br><br>Dad, you know what I think.<br><br>Certainly, that we'd better<br>get out of here.<br><br>Yes, we'd better get out of here.<br><br>Because my heart and not my good sense<br>is involved with Jerry.<br><br>It keeps saying, don't go, you've got him<br>to heck with all decency.<br><br>So, I think I'd better go.<br><br>Am I still your favorite daughter?<br><br>Right this minute I'm so proud of you,<br>I'd like to wake up Tom up...<br><br>...and give him a good thrashing<br>for not being another girl like you.<br><br>- Good night, Dad.<br>- Good night, Susan.<br><br>- Where are you going to sleep?<br>- In the guest room.<br><br>Oh, I forgot a robe and nightgown.<br><br>Hate to disturb her,<br>she's probably asleep.<br><br>Oh... oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>I thought you were asleep.<br><br>- I forgot a nightie.<br>- Oh, yes, this is your room.<br><br>I'm sorry to put you out.<br><br>I felt like the wreck of the Hesperus<br>the minute I looked at you.<br><br>I thought if I fixed myself up a little.<br><br>Most women take their make-up off<br>before going to bed.<br><br>I make sure mine's on just right.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Dad.<br><br>- Dad.<br>- What's the matter, what's the matter?<br><br>- There's nothing wrong with her.<br>- What?<br><br>Mrs. Marvin the first can walk,<br>she's a faker.<br><br>What makes you say that?<br><br>I put her bag with her lipstick<br>and compact...<br><br>...on the dresser, twenty feet<br>away from the bed.<br><br>Nobody was in that room after I left.<br><br>We were in this room, Jerry was<br>downstairs, I could hear him playing.<br><br>And when I went back in there,<br>she was using the lipstick and compact.<br><br>- But two doctors have examined her...<br>- Yes, I know.<br><br>I was there, I'll admit she has nerves,<br><br>she didn't even flinch<br>when they stuck pins in her.<br><br>But just the same, she's pretending<br>to be hurt so she can stay here.<br><br>Susan, for that stupid, jealous remark,<br>I'll report you to the Medical Association.<br><br>They'll put pickets around the house.<br><br>It's a serious accusation, Susan,<br>are you sure?<br><br>- I'm positive.<br>- Have you told Jerry?<br><br>No. I tried to, but I couldn't.<br>I've got to prove it.<br><br>How?<br><br>I don't know, but I'll make<br>her give herself away.<br><br>She's a very clever girl, Susan,<br>she's proven that.<br><br>Well, if she had twice the cunning<br>and three times the charm,<br><br>I'd still expose her, and in front<br>of Jerry too.<br><br>Well, it's every woman for herself<br>from now on.<br><br>And I'm betting on you, Suzie Q.<br><br>Get this one.<br><br>There came to the music Hall tonight<br>a man and his trumpet.<br><br>And...<br><br>Oh, this will warm the cockles<br>of your trumpet's heart.<br><br>- Jerry!<br>- Huh?<br><br>- This is your day to howl.<br>- Tom!<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot for a minute.<br><br>All your life I've tried to teach you<br>to curb your tongue.<br><br>Well, I suppose every man<br>should be permitted one failure.<br><br>And you are mine.<br><br>Breakfast is ready whenever<br>you wants it, Mr. Marvin.<br><br>- We'll wait for Miss Drake.<br>- Yes, sir.<br><br>- Good morning, you're Hattie, aren't you?<br>- Yessum.<br><br>- Good morning, Jerry?<br>- Good morning.<br><br>How's the patient this morning?<br><br>She seems to be fairly comfortable.<br><br>Oh, don't be upset, she'll be all right.<br><br>She'll be able to walk and before<br>very long too.<br><br>- I hope you're right.<br>- I know it, dear, I know it.<br><br>- Have you read Jerry's reviews?<br>- No, are they good?<br><br>Oh, let's have some breakfast first,<br>I'm famished.<br><br>Bring the papers along,<br>we'll read them in here.<br><br>Wow, what a night.<br><br>To top everything else,<br>our cook's sick this morning.<br><br>- I'll get breakfast.<br>- No, Hattie's got everything ready.<br><br>Oh, how nice of her.<br><br>- What would you like, eggs, bacon?<br>- Can I have my coffee now, please?<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>Go on, Hattie, see what Mrs. Marvin<br>wants, I'll get the coffee.<br><br>- Oh, let me get it.<br>- No, no, I'll get it.<br><br>The little lady certainly requires<br>a lot of attention, doesn't she?<br><br>Oh, have you thought of any plan<br>of getting her out of bed yet?<br><br>Oh, I've thought of a thousand<br>and one things, I tossed all night.<br><br>- You don't look it.<br>- This brightness came out of a compact.<br><br>Something I learned from Babe.<br><br>Say, why don't you sprinkle flour<br>on the floor around her bed?<br><br>Then, when she gets up,<br>she leaves her footprints.<br><br>Well, I've thought of sprinkling<br>ground glass on her food.<br><br>- What's wrong with that?<br>- Children.<br><br>Susan, I think you're being very unfair to<br>Jerry not telling him what you suspect.<br><br>But, Dad, I told you she...<br><br>Did you read that the common<br>cold costs the United States...<br><br>...five billion dollars in labor<br>hours alone?<br><br>And that's not adding in the cost<br>of nose drops either.<br><br>I hand't read that.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Hm-hmm.<br><br>- I'll take it, Mr. Marvin.<br>- Oh, thanks, Hattie.<br><br>Buzz, buzz, buzz, I can't ever<br>get a job done.<br><br>Poor Hattie. That buzzer's been going<br>ever since she got here.<br><br>- I've got it, I've got it!<br>- Hm? Got what?<br><br>Uh... oh, the answer to that formula<br>I've been working on.<br><br>- You know what I mean, Dad.<br>- Yes, I know.<br><br>Will you excuse me, please?<br><br>All of her ideas come to her<br>just like that.<br><br>Good morning, good morning,<br>how's our patient this morning?<br><br>A little better.<br><br>Has anyone ever told you<br>how beautiful you are?<br><br>Oh, you're just trying to make<br>me feel good. You have.<br><br>Hattie, what are you doing?<br><br>I'm trying to select a bed jacket.<br>Susan, help me pick one.<br><br>Oh, I think this one's very attractive.<br><br>Hattie, the men are starving,<br>you get breakfast, I'll help Miss Marvin.<br><br>- Yessum.<br>- Aren't you suppesed to be working...<br><br>- ...at the university or something?<br>- Yes, but... Oh, dear.<br><br>I want to be where I do the most good.<br><br>There, easy.<br>Careful with your back.<br><br>Oh... Hattie's really all I need.<br>She always takes care of me.<br><br>Oh, I imagine Harriet was very efficient<br>when the care you needed was just routine.<br><br>But this is an extraordinary occasion.<br>I really don't mind keeping an eye on you.<br><br>I don't want to keep you<br>from your work.<br><br>Don't you worry about that. This is just<br>as big a job as smashing a few atoms.<br><br>After all, we only pass through<br>this life once and...<br><br>any little kindness we can leave along<br>the way should be... left along the way.<br><br>There, now I'll have Hattie bring up<br>your tray right away.<br><br>What's up?<br><br>- Where's Jerry?<br>- In the kitchen.<br><br>You must help me keep him and Hattie<br>downstairs until the buzzer rings.<br><br>- Why?<br>- Well, it's very simple.<br><br>She's always ringing for Hattie,<br>isn't she?<br><br>- Uh-huh.<br>- What's that got to do with it?<br><br>Well, I moved the buzzer just<br>beyond her reach.<br><br>Not far enough for her to<br>become suspicious,<br><br>just so far enough so that she'll have<br>to get out of bed to ring.<br><br>- So the next time she buzzes...<br>- Is this my daughter Susan?<br><br>My honest and honorable child,<br>my sedate and dignified offspring?<br><br>That I should live to see her<br>degrade herself to...<br><br>Are you sure the buzzer's<br>far enough away from the bed?<br><br>Positive.<br><br>Really, Susan, you should read<br>the reviews on Jerry's concert.<br><br>Oh, I know they're good.<br>They are, aren't they, darling?<br><br>Sure, very good.<br><br>Would you like to have me read<br>them for you?<br><br>Yes, please do, Tom, read them well<br>and slowly, I want to hear every word.<br><br>Hattie!<br><br>"Tonight we heard Jerry Marvin tear away<br>the civilized veneer of mental gymnastics.<br><br>He said with music, here is a soul, base,<br>human, vile and saintly in turn.<br><br>- Good critic, he knows music.<br>- Oh, Jerry, you're wonderful.<br><br>Only in a conservative way.<br><br>- The bell, it's a bell.<br>- Yes, Susan.<br><br>The telephone. What's so unusual<br>about that?<br><br>Uh... nothing.<br><br>Only someone should answer it, that's why<br>it's ringing, so someone will answer it.<br><br>- I'll answer it.<br>- Well, it might be important.<br><br>It's the suspense that's killing me,<br>why doesn't she ring?<br><br>- Perhaps she can't walk.<br>- Yes, she can!<br><br>It's the laundry woman. Something about<br>a missing shirt or something.<br><br>Would you like to hear me read<br>the rest of this review?<br><br>Oh, yes, go through them all.<br><br>And Jerry, you must start a clipping book.<br><br>We'll put all the good ones in the front<br>and the bad ones in the back.<br><br>- Why put them in at all?<br>- Is there anything else, ma'am?<br><br>- No, thank you.<br>- Then I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray up now.<br><br>Oh, do you mind if I check it?<br><br>No, ma'am.<br><br>Let me see, the mayonnaise cream,<br>eggs, coffee.<br><br>Oh, Hattie, no toast, you must<br>prepare some toast immediately.<br><br>But Mrs. Marvin never takes toast<br>for breakfast, ma'am.<br><br>You remember that, don't you,<br>Mr. Marvin?<br><br>- That's right, she never takes toast.<br>- Oh, well, all right.<br><br>Oh, Hattie, is the coffee hot?<br><br>Oh... I'm sorry... it's my fault entirely.<br><br>How clumsy, I seem so jittery<br>this morning.<br><br>Well, I'll go and explain to Mrs. Marvin.<br><br>Hattie, you prepare another tray.<br><br>Hattie, is that you?<br><br>Hattie!<br><br>She was sleeping like a little baby.<br><br>Oh, you'll have plenty of time<br>to fix another tray,<br><br>- so would you get me some hot coffee?<br>- Yes, ma'am.<br><br>I'd like another cup of coffee too, please.<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>This is the best coffee we've had<br>since the boat.<br><br>I resent that.<br><br>Oh, deep down inside you know<br>you're no cook.<br><br>The inside of me resents that.<br><br>Jerry, they're trying to discourage<br>you from marrying me.<br><br>Sir, your daughter has informed me<br>that she can neither sew nor cook.<br><br>She's the soul of honesty.<br><br>Oh, dear, dear, take deep breaths.<br><br>How many times have I told you<br>not to gulp?<br><br>The buzzer.<br><br>Mrs. Marvin rang.<br><br>She wants her breakfast.<br><br>- Hattie, I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray.<br>- Yes, ma'am, I'll get the coffee.<br><br>- Come on, Jerry.<br>- Oh, excuse us.<br><br>- What's the hurry?<br>- I have a little surprise for you.<br><br>Let me take it.<br><br>Come in!<br>What happened to you?<br><br>Oh, I thought it was Hattie.<br><br>She was going to bring my coffee<br>half an hour ago.<br><br>It was my fault, I upset the first tray.<br><br>- Why didn't you ring, dear?<br>- I did.<br><br>But how could you?<br><br>Look where the bell is, you couldn't<br>possibly reach it without get...<br><br>Oh, I used this.<br><br>Hattie should have known better than<br>to put the table that far from you.<br><br>I guess it was my fault, I...<br><br>If you'll excuse me, I have a job<br>I have to take care of...<br><br>I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Hogarth.<br><br>- I didn't mean to be late, but...<br>- It's quite all right, Miss Drake.<br><br>Your father called this morning<br>and explained.<br><br>Nasty fall. Mrs. Marvin is quite<br>young, isn't she?<br><br>I'd just like to start you out on isolating<br>the lithium-6 atom, if you can do that.<br><br>Dr. Hogarth, you once worked<br>on nerve paralysis.<br><br>Would you come out and<br>examine Mrs. Marvin?<br><br>Oh, my dear girl, the last patient<br>I examined wore a bustle.<br><br>Now, if we can isolate the lithium-6 atom,<br><br>and then find a dye to carry it<br>direct to the cancer tissue...<br><br>But I'm sure if you looked<br>at Mrs. Marvin...<br><br>Oh, I think that the doctors called in<br>on the case are very capable.<br><br>Yes, they're all under seventy.<br><br>I beg your pardon.<br><br>Naturally I know paralysis can be<br>subconsciously induced.<br><br>But what are the chances of...<br>well, of faking?<br><br>Endless. I had a case once.<br><br>Astonishing. Not even a quiver<br>when jabbed with a pin.<br><br>An astounding display of...<br>of willpower.<br><br>I tried all the scientifical methods.<br>I even tried hypnotism.<br><br>But the patient was too wily.<br><br>I finally made him walk.<br><br>I wonder if we took a solution<br>both of lithium-6 and borom-10...<br><br>How did you make him walk,<br>what was the treatment?<br><br>You won't repeat this<br>because it wasn't quite ethical.<br><br>- Of course not.<br>- I got him drunk.<br><br>Of course I had to drink with him.<br><br>But I took aspirin to counteract<br>the stimulant.<br><br>He not only walked, he offered<br>to fight John L. Sullivan.<br><br>Thank you, Hattie, that's all.<br><br>Look what I found, champagne.<br><br>Where did you get that?<br><br>I found it in the cupboard<br>when I straightened them out.<br><br>Thought we might have<br>a little drink together.<br><br>How nice.<br><br>How about the others?<br><br>Oh, Dad and Tom have gone<br>to get Jerry.<br><br>You like champagne, don't you?<br><br>It's my favorite drink,<br>it always makes me very gay.<br><br>Oh, it's a pity I didn't think<br>of it sooner.<br><br>What shall we drink to?<br><br>How about to us?<br><br>- The old wife out, the new one in.<br>- Oh, no, that's too cruel.<br><br>Why?

Two doctors said so.<br><br>I've heard of people bedridden for years<br>who in a situation like this...<br><br>...suddenly find they can not<br>only walk, but run.<br><br>Well, my shock is a special<br>kind of shock.<br><br>Only a miracle can cure it.<br><br>And that'll take place at<br>Georgia Hot Springs.<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Smoke. It usually accompanies fire.<br><br>A few wet rags smouldering in a pale<br>would make a lot of smoke.<br><br>These old houses are like tinder boxes.<br><br>Once they catch on fire,<br>there's no putting them out.<br><br>It can't be much of a fire,<br>or you wouldn't still be here.<br><br>Oh, I'm going to stay to see<br>that you don't trip going down the stairs.<br><br>- What's that out there?<br>- The house is on fire, it's burning.<br><br>It's getting warm, don't you think?<br><br>Rats usually desert a sinking ship.<br><br>It hasn't reached the staircase yet, you can<br>make it if you hurry, but you've got to hurry.<br><br>I'm a cripple, someone will have<br>to carry me.<br><br>There's nobody here, just you<br>and me and the fire.<br><br>How cozy.<br><br>That fire isn't going to wait until<br>you've had your mineral baths,<br><br>your sunshine and freedom from<br>mental stress.<br><br>You won't let me burn.<br><br>No. No, I won't let you burn.<br><br>Come on. You can make it<br>if you hurry.<br><br>Susan! Susan!<br><br>Jerry!<br><br>You're very kind. Thanks anyway.<br><br>Susan, Babe!<br>Darling, are you all right?<br><br>Jerry, thank heavens you're here.<br><br>Don't be frightened, we'll have you<br>out of here in a minute.<br><br>Oh, Jerry, my back...<br><br>- Go ahead, Susan!<br>- Oh, my coat!

She tried to burn<br>me to death to prove I could walk.<br><br>I don't know why she should hate me.<br><br>She knows I wouldn't want to come<br>deliberately between you and her.<br><br>Babe, what kind of talk is this,<br>Susan set fire to the house.<br><br>She did it, she did, ask...<br><br>You win, Babe.<br><br>In every game somebody has to win,<br>somebody has to lose.<br><br>- You win.<br>- Game? Say, what is this anyway?<br><br>I'm sorry I caused all this<br>trouble, Jerry.<br><br>I'm sorry about the fire,<br>I'm sorry about everything.<br><br>Susan.<br><br>Susan!<br><br>Susan, it doesn't matter about the house,<br>there wasn't much damage done.<br><br>Anyway, it was insured...<br>Look out for the water!<br><br>You... you crazy fool!<br>What are you trying to do?<br><br>Babe, you were standing.<br><br>Yes... isn't it wonderful?<br><br>The doctor said only a miracle<br>would do it.<br><br>Yes, it is wonderful.<br><br>- Try it again.<br>- Oh, I don't think I could do it, Jerry.<br><br>Sure you can, come on.<br><br>You think I can?<br><br>- All right, for you, Jerry.<br>- Yes, just for me.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>- Now walk over to me.<br>- Walk?<br><br>Sure, come on.<br><br>That's it. Now another step.<br><br>That's fine! Come on, Babe.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>You little fraud!<br><br>Well, you can't blame a girl for trying!<br><br>You've had this coming<br>to you for years!<br><br>- Let me go!<br>- Jerry!<br><br>Jerry!

problem is,<br><br>is that my girlfriend<br>and I took mushrooms<br><br>and I seem to be<br>really upset right now<br><br>about something she did,<br><br>but I'm not going to<br>say what it is.<br><br>- What do you think she did?<br><br>- I think she was<br>playing a game.<br><br>I guess it's kind of like a game<br>of playing right now, but...<br><br>No, in that game,

to have a family<br>but I don't think I can.<br><br>- What do you mean?<br><br>What do you mean?<br>You don't think you can?<br><br>- Because all I care about<br>is writing poetry.<br><br>And going to gallery openings<br>and impressing my friends,<br><br>and basically maintaining<br>this image of myself<br><br>that is like the opposite<br>of holding a baby in my arms,<br><br>and being covered<br>in all that weird puke.<br><br>My mother is this<br>really cold intellectual type,<br><br>and I never really<br>got me love from her<br><br>unless I did<br>something exceptional.<br><br>And you see,<br>when I was like a kid,<br><br>I was like, really gifted.<br><br>And so I got a lot of love<br>from her because of that.<br><br>But now that<br>I'm not seen as like,<br><br>the most amazing poet or like,<br>even like adult, you know,<br><br>my mom seems to have, you know,<br><br>like, like,<br>disappeared from my life.<br><br>But I think it's like<br>in a meaningful way.<br><br>But also,
